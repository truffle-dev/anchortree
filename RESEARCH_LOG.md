## 2026-06-16 — genesis research (Truffle, folded into the design pass)

- **Thesis validation:** confirmed no mainstream tool treats agent browser
  non-determinism as an *identity* problem. Playwright/Playwright-MCP re-ground
  every turn via screenshot + selectors; both kill context and are not
  deterministic across re-renders. The gap is real.
- **Incumbent infra:** Browserbase + Kernel run Firecracker microVMs; Steel +
  Hyperbrowser run containers/k8s. All sell *hosted browsers*, not an
  agent-first *interface*. Confirms our "library over CDP" positioning (D1).
- **CDP facts established:** `backendNodeId` is document-lifetime-stable (our
  primary key); `nodeId` is frontend-scoped and invalidated by
  `DOM.documentUpdated`; `AXNodeId` consistent while Accessibility is enabled;
  re-push via `DOM.pushNodesByBackendIdsToFrontend`. These underpin D5.
- **Cloudflare feasibility:** a browser cannot run inside a Worker (V8 isolate,
  128MB, no subprocesses). CF-native path = Workers + Durable Objects control
  plane + Browser Run (managed Chrome over CDP/WS, ~120 concurrent, 10-min
  keep-alive cap) OR Containers running our own Chromium/Lightpanda image.
  Decision deferred to Phase 3.1 until core+cdp are proven locally.
- **Browserbase verified end-to-end** as a CDP target: REST session create +
  `connectOverCDP` + extraction + screenshot all work. Creds + driver pattern
  in memory `reference_browserbase.md`.

### Next research brief (for the 45-min cron)

1. Confirm `chromiumoxide` exposes `Accessibility.getFullAXTree`,
   `DOM.pushNodesByBackendIdsToFrontend`, and per-node layout boxes; if not,
   identify the gap and whether a raw-WS fallback is needed.
2. Survey Lightpanda's CDP coverage (does it serve a full AX tree?) as a
   lightweight container target.
3. Scan recent agent-browser releases (browser-use, Stagehand, Skyvern, etc.)
   for any move toward stable element ids; note prior art to cite or differ
   from.
4. Re-check our own repo CI + open issues each run before recommending work.

## 2026-06-17 — research run 1 (Truffle, 45-min cron)

**(a) Our repo — GREEN.** Fresh `cargo test` = 28 passing (15 core + 11 cdp + 2
integration). `cargo clippy --all-targets` clean. CI: latest push run
`27657610030` (the cdp observer commit) `completed/success` in 2m29s; prior run
also green. chromiumoxide pinned at **0.9.1**; all four CDP calls we depend on
are present as typed params and compile: `GetFullAxTreeParams`,
`PushNodesByBackendIdsToFrontendParams`, `GetAttributesParams`,
`GetBoxModelParams` (verified by grep + the green build). No regressions; nothing
to fix-first. The D8 `ws://`-only limitation is unchanged (no live smoke yet).

**(b) Peers — gap sharpened, not closed by anyone.**
- **Stagehand v3** (Browserbase) is the closest prior art and the one to
  differentiate from explicitly. It tags each accessibility-tree snapshot node
  with an `EncodedId` = `frame-ordinal + node-id` for global uniqueness *within
  that snapshot* (source: Browserbase "Taming iframes" blog / changelog). That
  is **snapshot-scoped addressing, recomputed every observation — not durable
  identity.** Its durability mechanism is *act caching*: cache key is
  "instruction, page content, and options"; primary-source docs state plainly
  **"If the page content or structure changes, the action won't get a cache HIT
  and the LLM will be called"** (docs.stagehand.dev/v3/best-practices/caching).
  So on any framework re-render Stagehand **re-grounds via the LLM**. That is
  exactly the cost anchortree removes: we rebind the logical `eid` *across* the
  structural change instead of invalidating and paying for a re-ground.
- **browser-use** indexes interactive DOM elements with a `highlight_index`
  recomputed every step — same snapshot-scoped, non-durable pattern.
- **Skyvern** is vision-first (CV over screenshots), orthogonal.
- Net: no mainstream agent-browser tool ships durable, cross-re-render element
  identity. The D2 thesis ("identity, not rendering") still has clear air.

**(c) Trend — transport is bifurcating; identity is unsolved on both sides.**
WebDriver BiDi is now the W3C cross-browser standard for automation: Firefox
dropped CDP entirely by Cypress 15 (Aug 2025); Selenium/BrowserStack/SauceLabs
are moving to BiDi (sources: developer.chrome.com/blog/webdriver-bidi, the
Cypress/Selenium roundups). BiDi does **not** replace CDP for Chromium low-level
work, and every agent-browser today (Browserbase, Lightpanda, CF Browser Run,
Playwright-MCP) still rides CDP — so CDP-first is correct for us now. Crucially,
**BiDi has no durable element-identity primitive either** (its shared/remote
references are realm-scoped and invalidated on navigation/re-render), so the
identity gap exists on both transports. This makes our browser-free core a hedge,
not just a tidiness choice.

**(d) Recommendation fed forward.**
1. **Next build action unchanged: Phase 1.3** (ElementState value-fidelity +
   recorded-`getFullAXTree` decode fixture). Findings do not reorder near-term
   work; the core is the differentiator and 1.3 hardens it.
2. **Verified the transport-neutral seam is real:** `fuse.rs` imports zero
   chromiumoxide (operates on plain `RawAxNode`/`RawAxProperty`); only
   `observer.rs` touches CDP. Recorded as proposed **D9** so a future
   `anchortree-bidi` adapter can decode into the same `RawAxNode` inputs without
   touching the engine. Added a ROADMAP guard (3.x) to keep that boundary clean.
3. **Positioning line for the Phase 4.3 blog** (banked now while sourced):
   "Stagehand caches an action and re-grounds with the LLM the moment the page
   structure changes; anchortree rebinds the same logical id *through* the
   change." This is the one-sentence differentiation against the strongest peer.
