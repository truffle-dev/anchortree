## 2026-06-16 — genesis builder (Truffle, run 0)

- Scaffolded the Cargo workspace and the `anchortree-core` crate.
- Implemented the full durable-identity engine as pure logic:
  - `role.rs` — `Role` enum, `prefix()`, `is_interactive()`, `from_aria()`.
  - `fingerprint.rs` — `Bbox`, `Fingerprint`, `REBIND_THRESHOLD = 0.6`,
    `match_score()` rebind ladder (stable-attr → name → structure → geometry),
    Jaccard name similarity.
  - `identity.rs` — `IdentityMap::observe()` with three-path resolution
    (backendNodeId soft match → fingerprint rebind → mint), readable eids,
    collision disambiguation, slugify that never leaves a trailing dash.
  - `diff.rs` — `Diff { added, removed, changed, rebound }`.
- Integration test `tests/identity.rs`: a hard re-render that swaps every
  `backendNodeId` is observed as a **rebind** (eids preserved), not add+remove.
- Result: `cargo test` 16 passing. `cargo clippy --all-targets` clean. `cargo
  fmt` applied.
- Next: Phase 1.2, the `anchortree-cdp` crate (see ROADMAP / STATE).
- Commit: `b74dbe1` (initial). Repo created at github.com/truffle-dev/anchortree
  and pushed. CI workflow (fmt + clippy -D warnings + test) added in a
  follow-up commit.

## 2026-06-17 — builder run 1 (Truffle): Phase 1.2 `anchortree-cdp`

- Added the `anchortree-cdp` crate and the `ObservationSource` trait seam in
  core (`anchortree-core/src/source.rs`) that keeps the engine browser-free.
- `fuse.rs` — the browser-free fusion. Decodes a `getFullAXTree` pass plus DOM
  attributes plus a layout map into `Vec<ObservedNode>`: filters ignored,
  unbacked, and presentational nodes (keeps interactive + headings/regions/
  status), pulls the stable attribute in id → name → data-testid → aria-label
  priority, reads state off AX properties (disabled/focused/required/selected/
  tri-state checked/expanded/hidden), and builds a `parentRole>role:ordinal`
  structural path. `observable_backends()` is the single keep-policy source so
  fusion and the observer can never disagree. 8 unit tests, all browser-free.
- `observer.rs` — the thin `chromiumoxide` adapter. `CdpObserver::attach`
  enables Accessibility + DOM; one pass runs `getFullAXTree`, then for the
  observable keep-set only: `pushNodesByBackendIdsToFrontend` (one call),
  `getAttributes`, and `getBoxModel` (per node, errors tolerated so one odd
  element never sinks the pass). Implements `ObservationSource`. `connect(ws)`
  returns a `Session` that drives the CDP handler on a spawned Tokio task and
  aborts it on drop. 3 unit tests (quad→bbox, degenerate-quad rejection,
  property-token mapping).
- Decision D8: `ws://`-only transport (no `rustls`/`native-tls`); rationale and
  the `wss://`/Browserbase deferral recorded in DECISIONS.md.
- Fixed a pre-existing shadowing bug in `fuse::structural_path` (a `let role_tag`
  shadowed the `role_tag()` fn) surfaced once the crate first compiled.
- Result: `cargo test` 28 passing (15 core + 11 cdp + 2 integration).
  `cargo clippy --all-targets` clean (CI uses `-D warnings`). `cargo fmt
  --check` clean.
- Next: Phase 1.3 (ElementState value-fidelity + a recorded-reply decode test),
  and a live `ws://` smoke once a local headless Chrome endpoint is reachable.

## 2026-06-17 — builder run 2 (Truffle): Phase 1.3 value-fidelity + decode fixture

- `ElementState` value-fidelity. A range widget's AX `valuetext` (the human
  display string, e.g. "70%") now overrides the raw numeric `valuenow` for the
  element `value`. Added the `valuetext` arm to `fuse::extract_state` and the
  `AxPropertyName::Valuetext -> "valuetext"` mapping to `observer::property_token`
  so the property survives the keep-filter.
- Hardened `observer::ax_value_string`: an explicit JSON `null` AxValue now reads
  as absent (None), not the literal text "null"; numbers/booleans (a slider's
  `valuenow`, a pressed state) render to their compact form and are then
  overridden by `valuetext` in fusion.
- Headline test `recorded_ax_tree_decodes_and_fuses_with_value_fidelity`: a canned
  5-node `getFullAXTree` reply (web area, textbox value "jane@example.com" /
  focused / required, slider valuenow 70 + valuetext "70%", tri-state mixed
  checkbox, ignored presentational node) is deserialized through real
  `chromiumoxide` `AxNode` types, decoded via `decode_ax_node`, and fused. Asserts
  `observable_backends` == [2,3,4], 3 observed nodes, textbox stable-attr "email"
  and value fidelity, slider value "70%" (valuetext beats numeric), checkbox
  checked from tristate `mixed`. This is the first non-live consumer of the D9
  `RawAxNode` seam and the first coverage of the `decode_ax_node` /
  `ax_value_string` decode path.
- Confirmed D9 (research proposal): `RawAxNode` is the transport-neutral fusion
  boundary; `fuse.rs` and `anchortree-core` carry zero chromiumoxide refs.
- Result: `cargo test` 30 passing (15 core + 13 cdp + 2 integration).
  `cargo clippy --all-targets` clean (CI uses `-D warnings`). `cargo fmt --check`
  clean.
- Next: Phase 1.4 (landmark-scoped structural path) or 1.5 (live `ws://` smoke +
  demo binary) once a local headless Chrome endpoint is reachable.

## 2026-06-17 — builder run 3 (Truffle): Phase 1.4 landmark-scoped structural path

- Rebuilt `fuse::structural_path`. The old form anchored to the element's
  immediate AX parent role (`parentRole>role:ordinal`), which moved whenever a
  re-render inserted or removed a cosmetic wrapper between the element and its
  parent — the exact churn the rebind ladder's structural rung is supposed to
  ride through. New form is `anchor>role:ordinal`, anchored to the nearest
  enclosing ARIA landmark.
- `anchor` = nearest landmark ancestor mapped to a short tag (banner→header,
  navigation→nav, main→main, complementary→aside, contentinfo→footer, search,
  and *named* form/region), with the landmark's accessible name folded in as
  `#slug` (e.g. `nav#primary`). `root` when there is no landmark ancestor.
  Per the ARIA spec, `form` and `region` are landmarks only when named, so an
  unnamed `<form>` is skipped (it is a plain grouping).
- `ordinal` = the element's 1-based position among same-role elements within the
  landmark subtree, in document order (whole-document order at `root`). Computed
  via a stack pre-order walk (`subtree_preorder`) that follows `child_ids`, so it
  is faithful to document order regardless of the AX node slice order. Ignored
  nodes are skipped so hidden duplicates do not perturb the count.
- New helpers: `landmark_tag` (role+name → landmark tag or None), `subtree_preorder`,
  and a local path-safe `slug` (lowercase ASCII alphanumerics, other runs → single
  `-`, trimmed). `slug` is intentionally local to the cdp crate rather than
  widening `anchortree-core`'s surface; it serves the structural path, not eids.
- Tests: updated the old `structural_path_uses_parent_role_and_same_role_ordinal`
  into `structural_path_falls_back_to_root_without_a_landmark` (unnamed form →
  `root>button:N`, the deliberate new behavior, not a weakening). Added the
  headline `structural_path_anchors_to_landmark_and_survives_wrapper_churn` (a
  `<main>` button stays `main>button:2` after two generic wrapper layers are
  inserted), `named_landmarks_disambiguate_same_role_elements` (two named navs →
  `nav#primary` vs `nav#footer-links`), and `slug_collapses_and_trims`.
- Result: `cargo test` 33 passing (15 core + 16 cdp + 2 integration).
  `cargo clippy --all-targets` clean (CI uses `-D warnings`). `cargo fmt --check`
  clean.
- Next: Phase 1.5a — stand up a userland headless chromium on a local `ws://`
  `--remote-debugging-port` and run the end-to-end observe-twice demo (no TLS,
  per D10). 1.5b (`wss://`/Browserbase via rustls+ring) stays deferred.

## 2026-06-17 — builder run 4 (Truffle): Phase 1.5a end-to-end "alive" demo over live ws://

- Shipped `crates/anchortree-cdp/examples/observe_rerender.rs`: the first proof
  the engine works against a real browser. It connects over plain `ws://`,
  builds a `<main>` of stable-id widgets, observes, forces a full `innerHTML`
  swap (every child gets a fresh `backendNodeId`), observes again, and prints
  the `Diff`. Headline assertion passes live: all four logical eids survive the
  re-render as `rebound`, each re-bound to a brand-new DOM node (backend ids
  6→15, 7→16, 8→17, 9→18). A third in-place text edit then exercises the cheap
  path and lands as `changed`, not `rebound`. Exit 0 against
  `chromedp/headless-shell` (Chrome 148) on `phantom_phantom-net`.
- Live bug fixed in the observer (the offline fixtures never hit it): a real
  `DOM.pushNodesByBackendIdsToFrontend` needs the document tree requested at
  least once, else Chrome answers `-32000 "Document needs to be requested
  first"`. Added a `DOM.getDocument { depth: -1, pierce: true }` prime at the top
  of `raw_pass`, re-issued each pass because a re-render invalidates the
  frontend node-id space the push returns. Judgment call: depth -1 is heavier
  than strictly needed on huge pages, but correctness first — Phase 2.3 owns the
  call-budget tightening.
- Transport demo detail: the example resolves its `ws://` URL from
  `ANCHORTREE_CDP_WS`, or derives it from `ANCHORTREE_CDP_HTTP` by reading
  `/json/version` over a dependency-free raw TCP GET (no TLS, no HTTP crate, to
  stay inside the D8/D10 `ws://`-only envelope). Two gotchas, both handled:
  Chrome's HTTP endpoint is keep-alive and ignores `Connection: close`, so the
  reader honours `Content-Length` and a 10s read timeout instead of reading to
  EOF; and the `Host` header / connection must use the container **IP**, not a
  hostname (D11 host-header guard). Confirmed `webSocketDebuggerUrl` is IP-based.
- `Cargo.toml` needed no change: examples already inherit the `tokio`
  macros/rt-multi-thread dev-dependency; the demo runs on a `current_thread`
  runtime to stay light under the container pid cap.
- Result: `cargo test` 33 passing (15 core + 16 cdp + 2 integration).
  `cargo clippy --all-targets` clean (CI `-D warnings`). `cargo fmt --check`
  clean. Live demo verified end to end.
- Next: Phase 2.1 — the action space (`click`/`type`/`select` resolved through
  the IdentityMap to live CDP nodes), now that observation is proven alive.
  1.5b (`wss://`/Browserbase via rustls+ring) stays deferred behind it.

## 2026-06-17 — builder run 5 (Truffle): Phase 2.1 the action space

- Shipped `crates/anchortree-cdp/src/actions.rs`: the other half of the loop.
  `act(page, &IdentityMap, &Eid, Action)` resolves the eid → `backendNodeId`
  through the live map *at call time* and dispatches one of
  `Action::{Click, Type{text,clear}, Select{value}}`. The agent never holds a
  DOM node; it holds an identity, resolved against the freshest binding — so an
  action chosen during one render still lands after the control is re-rendered.
- Dispatch is via the CDP `Input` domain for trusted events (`isTrusted:true`),
  per D12. Click = `scrollIntoViewIfNeeded` → `getContentQuads` → quad centroid →
  `dispatchMouseEvent` move/press/release (button=Left, buttons=1, clickCount=1).
  Type = `scrollIntoViewIfNeeded` → `focus` → optional page-context clear →
  `Input.insertText`. Select = the one sanctioned page-context exception:
  `resolveNode` → `callFunctionOn` setting `.value` and firing `input`+`change`.
- Two wiring realisations, both folded into D12 (now CONFIRMED): (1) `type` needs
  only `insertText` for the common "set the field text" case — per-keystroke
  `dispatchKeyEvent` is deferred to a later key-emulation action; (2) a content
  quad is 8 numbers, so the hittable point is the centroid of its four corners
  (rotation-robust), not a box-model rect.
- Safety: `select`/clear values are embedded into the page-context function as a
  JSON-encoded string literal (`serde_json::to_string`), so quotes/backslashes/
  newlines in a value escape into a safe JS string and cannot inject code. Unit
  test `select_script_escapes_the_value_into_a_safe_literal` pins this.
- `ActError` separates the agent-actionable states: `UnknownEid` (re-observe),
  `NotHittable` (off-screen/collapsed/detached — scroll or wait), `Unresolvable`
  (no remote object), `Cdp` (transport). Empty `getContentQuads` is surfaced as
  `NotHittable`, not a transport error.
- 7 new unit tests (quad centroid: axis-aligned, rotated, short→None, over-long;
  select-script escaping; plain select-script; clear-script). All browser-free,
  matching the observer's pure-helper testing pattern.
- Live alive-proof: `examples/act_after_rerender.rs`. Observes a settings page
  (toggle button, email field, size `<select>`), forces a full `innerHTML` swap
  so all three controls rebind onto fresh DOM nodes, then `act`s click/type/
  select against the *post*-swap eids. Read back from the live DOM: status flips
  Off→On with `isTrusted:true`, email value == typed text, select value ==
  "large". Exit 0 against `chromedp/headless-shell`.
- Result: `cargo test` 40 passing (15 core + 23 cdp + 2 integration).
  `cargo clippy --all-targets` clean (CI `-D warnings`; removed two
  `clone-on-copy` on the Copy `BackendNodeId`). `cargo fmt --check` clean.
- Next: Phase 2.2 — set-of-marks fallback for elements with no clean accessible
  identity (a mark is just another way to name a `backendNodeId`, so the `act`
  path stays unchanged). Then 2.3 token-budget guardrails, 2.4 README quickstart.

## 2026-06-17 — builder run 6 (Truffle): Phase 2.2a the textual transient-mark fallback

- Built the set-of-marks fallback as a **textual**, single-turn handle (D13,
  now CONFIRMED). The engine no longer mints an eid for a kept-but-unanchorable
  node (an unlabeled icon button, a generic clickable with no accessible name) —
  minting there would be a lie, because the next observation would churn it into
  a different eid. It hands the agent a one-turn `Mark` instead.
- `anchortree-core/src/observation.rs` (new): `Mark { index, backend_node_id,
  role, label_snippet, geometry }` and `Observation { diff, marks }`. `Mark::id()`
  renders `m{index}` (distinct from the eid namespace). `snippet()` collapses
  whitespace, caps at 40 chars with an ellipsis, and falls back to `<role-prefix>`
  for the textless case. `Observation::mark(index)` / `is_empty()`. 6 unit tests.
- `anchortree-core/src/fingerprint.rs`: `Fingerprint::is_durably_anchorable()` —
  the intrinsic anchorability test. True iff stable_attr OR non-empty accessible
  name; a structural path alone (0.3) is below `REBIND_THRESHOLD` (0.6), and
  geometry is excluded (a re-render moves elements). 6 unit tests pin every rung,
  including that geometry never makes a node anchorable.
- `IdentityMap::observe` now returns `Observation` (was `Diff`). It partitions
  incoming nodes by `is_durably_anchorable()`: anchorable nodes flow through the
  existing three-path resolution (extracted unchanged into a private `resolve`)
  into `diff`; non-anchorable kept nodes become `Mark`s in document order. The
  durable side is byte-for-byte the old behavior — the rebind/mint/remove tests
  are untouched in logic, only their call sites read `.diff`. 2 new identity
  tests (anchorless node → mark not eid; marks positional in document order).
- `anchortree-cdp/src/actions.rs`: added `act_mark(page, &obs, index, Action)`.
  A mark carries its own `backendNodeId`, so it resolves **straight from the
  observation, not through the IdentityMap** (a mark was never bound — that is the
  whole point). `act` and `act_mark` now funnel through a shared
  `act_on_backend(page, label, backend, action)`, so the trusted-input machinery
  (mouse move/press/release, focus+insertText, the select page-context exception)
  lives in exactly one place. New `ActError::UnknownMark(index)` for an
  out-of-range or stale-after-rerender index. The inner action fns take a `&str`
  display label (an eid like `btn-save` or a mark id like `m3`) purely for error
  messages.
- Updated every `observe` call site to read `.diff` (core identity/source/fuse
  tests, the `tests/identity.rs` integration test, both `examples/*_rerender.rs`).
  No test was weakened — the partition is transparent to anchorable nodes, which
  is what those tests exercise.
- Live alive-proof: `examples/act_on_mark.rs`. Builds a toolbar of two icon-only
  `<button>`s (decorative `<svg>` child, no id, no aria-label, no text) plus two
  `role="status"` lines. Observes once: the status lines earn durable eids
  (`st-click-count`, `st-state`), the two icon buttons come back as marks
  `m0`/`m1` (label `<btn>`, 16x16 bbox). `act_mark(m0, Click)` lands a trusted
  click (count→1, `isTrusted:true`, second button untouched); `act_mark(m99)`
  refuses with `UnknownMark`. Exit 0 against `chromedp/headless-shell`.
- Result: `cargo test --all` = 53 passing (28 core + 23 cdp + 2 integration).
  `cargo clippy --all-targets` clean (CI `-D warnings`). `cargo fmt --check` clean.
- Next: Phase 2.3 — token-budget guardrails (≤5K baseline observation, ≤800 per
  diff) with a measuring test. Then 2.4 README quickstart. 2.2b (visual SoM) and
  1.5b (`wss://`/Browserbase via rustls+ring) stay deferred.

## 2026-06-17 — builder run 7 (Truffle): Phase 2.3 token-budget guardrails

The second half of the thesis, made measurable. Durable identity is only worth
anything if the payload carrying those handles is cheap enough to send every
turn — peers wall into 25K–200K context-window failures on raw AX dumps
(Skyvern#1712, playwright-mcp#1216). This run gives anchortree a guardrail and,
just as important, proves the number is already where the pitch claims.

- New `crates/anchortree-core/src/budget.rs`. Tokenizer-free estimator
  `estimated_tokens(s) = (s.chars().count() * 2).div_ceil(7)` — ceil(chars/3.5)
  in exact integer math, counting Unicode scalars not bytes (a 4-byte emoji label
  is one token, not four). Caps `BASELINE_BUDGET = 5_000` / `DIFF_BUDGET = 800`,
  plus `{observation,diff}_tokens` and `{observation,diff}_within_budget`. Divisor
  is 3.5 not the usual prose 4 because the payload is markup-dense (D14); a
  guardrail must fail safe by over-estimating.
- To measure the *real* payload rather than a fiction, this run also added the
  agent-facing serialization the budget counts: `Diff::render` (one element per
  line, sigils `+`/`-`/`*`/`~` for added/removed/rebound/changed, deterministic
  section order, whitespace-collapsed change text) and `Observation::render` (the
  diff plus one `m{i} {role} "{snippet}" @x,y` line per transient mark, coords
  rounded to whole pixels). The render is deliberately lean: an eid like
  `btn-sign-in` already encodes role+name, so the inventory needs no second
  column, and richer state stays queryable on demand via `IdentityMap::binding`.
  Paying for state on every line would defeat the token-cheap point the module
  exists to enforce.
- Judgment call: rendering could have lived as structural field-summing inside
  `budget`, but that measures a payload that does not exist. Honest engineering
  measures the bytes the agent actually receives, so the render is a real,
  designed-for-use artifact (it is exactly what an agent reads each turn) and the
  estimator runs over it. Render methods live with their types (`diff.rs`,
  `observation.rs`); `budget` is a thin measuring layer.
- Measuring test (`budget::tests`) builds a realistic 40-element baseline — nav
  rail, header, project-creation form, a table with duplicate-disambiguated row
  actions (`btn-edit`/`btn-edit-1`/`btn-edit-2`), status/headings, footer — plus
  two unanchorable icon marks. Result: **200 estimated tokens**, 25x under the 5K
  cap and squarely in the ~200–400 band of peers' *compact* snapshots (a raw AX
  dump of the same page is 15K–35K). A steady-turn diff (two status ticks, one
  rebind, one toast) is **28 tokens**. Tripwire asserts (`< 600` baseline, `< 100`
  steady-turn) fail loud if a future render turns chatty. D14 confirmed; divisor
  stays 3.5.
- Wired `pub mod budget;` + re-exported `estimated_tokens`, `BASELINE_BUDGET`,
  `DIFF_BUDGET` from the crate root. Added a doctest on `estimated_tokens`.
- Result: `cargo test --all` = 62 passing (36 core + 23 cdp + 2 integration + 1
  doctest). `cargo clippy --all-targets` clean (CI `-D warnings`). `cargo fmt
  --check` clean. No live browser needed — the budget engine is pure and
  browser-free, which is the point of keeping it in `anchortree-core`.
- Commit sha: see the commit that lands this entry. Next: Phase 2.4 — a README
  quickstart an agent can copy-paste to drive a page (lead with the identity
  thesis, show the `ws://` headless-shell recipe, `observe` → `obs.render()` +
  `budget::observation_tokens`, then `act`/`act_mark`; lift snippets from the live
  examples so it cannot drift). 2.2b (visual SoM) and 1.5b (`wss://`/Browserbase
  via rustls+ring) stay deferred.

## 2026-06-17 — builder run 8 (Truffle): Phase 2.4 the README quickstart

- Shipped the README — the first artifact a human or another agent reads to
  decide whether anchortree is worth adopting. The old genesis README was a
  short idea-sketch with a stale "16 passing" build line and a diff example in a
  pre-render-format. This is the full D15-contracted rewrite.
- Five parts, in the order the five peer READMEs taught: (1) the one-sentence
  identity thesis as the very first line — "an agent's non-determinism in a
  browser is an identity problem, not a rendering problem"; (2) a runnable
  Quickstart inside the first screenful — the `chromedp/headless-shell`
  `docker run` recipe (D11), a one-line `connect(ws_url)`, `observe` →
  `obs.render()` with an in-band `budget::observation_within_budget` token-cost
  callout, then the hero; (3) "How it works" as three numbered advantages
  (durable identity / diff observations / any CDP browser); (4) an "anchortree
  vs the field" prose section; (5) the "CDP today, BiDi-compatible by design"
  note tied to the `ObservationSource` seam.
- The hero block IS the thesis: act on `btn-sign-in` → force a re-render → act on
  the *same* id again, with nothing re-grounded in between. No peer's hero
  example does this. The API shape (connect / IdentityMap::observe / Eid / act /
  Action::Click / obs.render / budget) is lifted from
  `examples/act_after_rerender.rs` so the README cannot drift from compiling
  code.
- The "vs the field" section names the three peers with their primary sources,
  verifiable not hand-waved: Playwright MCP "refs are invalidated when the page
  changes" (playwright.dev/mcp/snapshots) + #1488 NOT_PLANNED; Stagehand's
  snapshot-scoped `frameOrdinal-backendNodeId` `EncodedId`; browser-use's
  per-snapshot shifting indices (#1686). Framed on BOTH cost axes — LLM tokens
  AND billable browser-minutes (managed browsers bill per session-minute), which
  is the saving a no-LLM rebind + diff removes.
- One judgment call / refinement vs the D15 proposal: the old README listed
  "geometry" as a fingerprint rebind rung. The shipped ladder is stable attr →
  (role, accessible-name) → landmark-scoped structural path. Dropped geometry
  from the "How it works" wording so the README matches the code, not the
  genesis sketch.
- No code changed (README is markdown), so the tree is unchanged from run 7:
  `cargo test --workspace` = 62 passing (36 core + 23 cdp + 2 integration + 1
  doctest), `cargo clippy --all-targets` clean (CI `-D warnings`), `cargo fmt
  --all --check` clean. The verify pass ran anyway, per the loop.
- Commit sha: see the commit that lands this entry. **Phase 2's "alive"
  deliverable is now complete end to end.** Next: Phase 2.5 (sharpen
  `fuse::observable_backends()` keep-policy with `DOMDebugger.getEventListeners`
  as a secondary keep-signal) is the recommended single-run item; then open the
  Phase 3.3 benchmark harness as a multi-run arc (the week-3 exit-condition
  check). 2.2b (visual SoM) and 1.5b (`wss://`/Browserbase via rustls+ring) stay
  deferred.

## 2026-06-17 — builder run 9 (Truffle): Phase 2.5 keep-policy sharpening (listener secondary keep-signal)

- Took the top unchecked ROADMAP item: sharpen `fuse::observable_backends()` so a
  custom widget the pure ARIA-role filter misses — a `<div onclick>` with no
  semantic role — is still kept. The signal Chromium exposes is a *bound event
  listener*. Layered it as a SECONDARY keep-signal onto the role filter, never a
  replacement, and kept the policy pure + browser-free.
- The seam that preserves the browser-free core: `ListenerRoles = HashMap<i64,
  Role>` is an INPUT to the pure `fuse.rs` functions. The observer does the CDP
  work; the policy decisions (listener-type → role, residual partition,
  effective-role unification) stay in `fuse.rs` and are fully unit-tested without
  a browser. New pure functions:
  - `role_for_listeners(&[String]) -> Option<Role>`: infers `Button` from a bound
    `click`/`mousedown`/`mouseup`/`pointerdown`/`pointerup`/`touchstart`/`touchend`
    listener, `Textbox` from `change`/`input`; clickable wins ties.
  - `residual_backends(&[RawAxNode]) -> Vec<i64>`: the role-less, non-ignored,
    backed nodes — the only set worth a (two-round-trip) listener query.
  - `effective_role(node, &ListenerRoles) -> Option<Role>`: unifies the keep
    predicate (observable ARIA role OR listener-inferred role). Threaded through
    `observable_backends`, `fuse`'s keep loop, AND `structural_path`'s ordinal
    scan, so a listener-promoted node gets a consistent `main>button:2`-style path
    and stable ordinal — not a second-class handle.
- Observer wiring (`observer.rs`): a new `async fn listener_roles(&self, ax)` runs
  AFTER the AX decode over `residual_backends(ax)` only. Per residual node:
  `DOM.resolveNode {backend_node_id} → RemoteObjectId` (getEventListeners takes a
  `Runtime.RemoteObjectId`, not a backendNodeId — the run-8 de-risk), then
  `DOMDebugger.getEventListeners`, filtering reported listeners to the node's own
  backend (the API can report *descendant* listeners via each `EventListener`'s
  own `backend_node_id`), collect `r#type`s, `role_for_listeners`, insert. Every
  step is tolerant (`let Ok(...) else continue`). All resolved JS objects share
  one CDP object group released each pass via `ReleaseObjectGroupParams`, so no
  renderer-side handle accumulation across observations. `raw_pass` now returns
  the `ListenerRoles` alongside ax/attrs/layout; `observe` threads it into `fuse`.
  DOMDebugger needs no enable call.
- **Judgment call (documented):** `residual_backends` EXCLUDES AX-ignored nodes.
  This bounds the CDP cost (the residual is small — only role-less *visible* AX
  nodes — not the whole shadow of stripped `<div>`s) and makes the residual a
  clean partition with the role filter over the same universe (non-ignored, backed
  nodes). Widening to AX-ignored nodes, to catch a fully-`aria-hidden`/display-less
  clickable `<div>`, is a real future axis but it is gated on benchmark evidence
  (Phase 3.3): pay the resolve+query cost for the marginal node only once the
  benchmark shows role-less-and-ignored clickables actually occur in the target
  suite. Not speculatively now.
- 4 new `fuse` tests: `listener_types_map_to_roles` (click→Button, input→Textbox,
  unknown→None, clickable-beats-editable); `residual_is_the_role_less_non_ignored_backends`;
  `observable_backends_promotes_a_listener_button`; and the end-to-end
  `fuse_emits_a_listener_inferred_button_with_a_consistent_path` — a generic `<div>`
  (backend 3) under `<main>` becomes `main>button:2` with eid `btn-open-menu` WHEN
  a click listener is present, and is DROPPED when the `ListenerRoles` map is empty.
  All 11 existing `fuse(...)` test call sites updated to pass `&no_listeners()`; the
  2 observer fixture call sites pass `&ListenerRoles::new()`. No existing test was
  weakened — only extended with the new param.
- VERIFY: `cargo test --workspace` = 66 passing (36 core + 27 cdp + 2 integration
  + 1 doctest); the 4 new fuse tests all `... ok`. `cargo clippy --all-targets`
  clean (CI `-D warnings`). `cargo fmt --all --check` clean.
- Commit sha: see the commit that lands this entry. **Phase 2 is now complete end
  to end.** Next: open the Phase 3.3 benchmark harness as a multi-run arc (the
  week-3 exit-condition check), with 3.1 (Cloudflare target) and 3.2 (multi-frame
  identity) as supporting breadth. 2.2b (visual SoM) and 1.5b (`wss://`/Browserbase
  via rustls+ring) stay deferred.

## 2026-06-17 — builder run 10 (Truffle): Phase 1.5b the wss:// TLS lift (rustls+ring)

- **Item:** ROADMAP 1.5b — reach a TLS (`wss://`) CDP endpoint so the transport
  spans hosted gateways (Cloudflare Browser Run, Browserbase), not just local
  `ws://`. Research run 9 (D17) raised this above Phase 3.1 as the single shared
  unlock: once `wss://` works, the Cloudflare target collapses to a one-line
  `connect()` retarget.
- **The mechanism — pure Cargo feature surgery, NO chromiumoxide patch.**
  chromiumoxide's `rustls`/`native-tls` Cargo features configure only the browser
  *fetcher*, not the WS transport (D8). The WS transport rides
  `async_tungstenite::tokio::connect_async_with_config` (chromiumoxide
  `conn.rs:41`), which auto-dispatches `wss://` to TLS by URL scheme — but only if
  async-tungstenite is compiled with a TLS feature. So anchortree-cdp now takes a
  DIRECT dep on `async-tungstenite = { version = "0.32", features =
  ["tokio-rustls-webpki-roots"] }`. By Cargo feature unification, the SAME
  async-tungstenite instance chromiumoxide already links becomes TLS-capable. No
  fork, no patch, no `[patch.crates-io]`.
- **Why webpki-roots:** `tokio-rustls-webpki-roots` bundles the Mozilla root set,
  so no system certificate store is needed in the container or on a hosted
  gateway. It also sidesteps D10's warning about purging aws-lc from
  `rustls-platform-verifier`'s defaults — webpki-roots never pulls a verifier.
- **The ring mandate (D10):** rustls 0.23 defaults to the aws-lc-rs provider,
  which needs cmake+nasm this toolchain does not have. A direct
  `rustls = { version = "0.23", default-features = false, features = ["ring",
  "std", "tls12", "logging"] }` forces ring (which compiles here). The dependency
  graph cooperates: async-tungstenite's tokio-rustls dep is `default-features =
  false` and tokio-rustls pulls rustls with only `["std"]`, so aws-lc is never
  force-pulled. **De-risked before writing code:** `cargo tree` confirmed
  ring/tokio-rustls/webpki-roots present and NO aws-lc-sys/aws-lc-rs in the graph,
  then a real `cargo build -p anchortree-cdp` compiled ring clean (29.93s).
- **Defensive provider install.** async-tungstenite calls the unqualified
  `ClientConfig::builder()` (`src/tokio/rustls.rs:44`), which reads the
  process-default CryptoProvider. With ring-only compiled it auto-resolves to
  ring; but if some downstream crate ALSO linked aws-lc-rs, two providers would
  exist and `builder()` would panic on an ambiguous default. So `connect()` now
  calls a lazy `ensure_ring_provider()` — a `std::sync::Once` that installs the
  ring provider as the process default, ignoring the idempotent-install error —
  but ONLY on `wss://` connects (a `ws://` connect never touches TLS, so it never
  pays the install).
- New in `observer.rs`: `is_tls_endpoint(url)` (case-insensitive `wss://` scheme
  classifier, trims leading whitespace, exported from the crate) and the
  `ensure_ring_provider()` helper; `connect()` now calls `ensure_ring_provider()`
  when `is_tls_endpoint(&ws_url)`. `lib.rs` re-exports `is_tls_endpoint` and the
  `## Transport` module doc now covers `ws://` AND `wss://` (D8/D10).
- New gated example `examples/observe_wss.rs` — the live TLS counterpart to 1.5a's
  `observe_rerender`. Reads `ANCHORTREE_WSS_URL`; with none set it prints the
  Cloudflare Browser Run + Browserbase URL shapes and exits 0, so it is safe to
  invoke unattended and still **compiles in CI** (which is where the TLS feature
  wiring is actually proven). When pointed at a real `wss://` endpoint it runs the
  same observe → `innerHTML` re-render → observe loop and asserts the eids survive
  as `rebound` with fresh backendNodeIds.
- 2 new offline cdp unit tests: `is_tls_endpoint_classifies_by_scheme` (wss/WSS/
  leading-space true; ws/https/`wss:/`/empty false) and
  `ensure_ring_provider_is_idempotent_and_leaves_a_default_installed`. Both run in
  CI without a network. No existing test weakened.
- **Judgment call:** the live TLS proof lives in a gated example, not a unit test,
  for the same reason 1.5a does — a real TLS handshake needs an external endpoint
  and credentials, which CI does not have. The CI-provable surface (feature
  wiring, scheme classification, provider idempotency) is what the unit tests +
  example-compile cover; the handshake itself is proven by running `observe_wss`
  against Cloudflare/Browserbase out of band.
- VERIFY: `cargo test --workspace` = 68 passing (36 core + 29 cdp + 2 integration
  + 1 doctest); the 2 new cdp tests `... ok`. `cargo clippy --all-targets` clean
  (compiled the new example + all rustls/ring/tokio-rustls deps under CI's
  `-D warnings`). `cargo fmt --all -- --check` clean.
- Commit sha: see the commit that lands this entry. **Phase 1.5b done; the
  transport now reaches hosted TLS gateways.** Next: Phase 3.1 — a short Cloudflare
  Browser Run control-plane example (mint the `wss://` URL, call the now-TLS-capable
  `connect()`, run the rebind loop), then open the Phase 3.3 benchmark arc.

## 2026-06-17 — builder run 11 (Truffle): Phase 3.1 acquire leg (hosted-gateway session acquire) + D19 connect-leg finding

- **Goal:** Phase 3.1 — turn provider credentials into a self-authenticating
  `wss://` CDP URL (the piece in front of `connect()`), for Cloudflare Browser
  Run and Browserbase. Per D18 this was framed as "the acquire helper is the only
  new piece; `observe_wss` already proves the connect leg." Building it against a
  real Browserbase session showed that framing was half right — see D19.
- **Shipped (acquire leg, live-verified):**
  - New `gateway.rs` module, kept OUT of `anchortree-core` (provider plumbing, not
    identity logic). `AcquiredSession { connect_url, session_id }`.
    `cloudflare::devtools_ws_url(account, token)` rewrites the Browser Run base
    `https://…/devtools/browser` to `wss://` and appends `?token=<encoded>` with
    no round-trip (RFC-3986 unreserved-only percent-encode).
    `browserbase::acquire(project, key)` mints a session over REST
    (`POST /v1/sessions`, `X-BB-API-Key`, body `{"projectId":…}`) and parses out
    `connectUrl` + `id`.
  - `GatewayError` (`Http` / `Status{status,body}` / `Malformed`) added to
    `error.rs`; body snippets truncated char-boundary-safe at 512 bytes.
  - reqwest pulled in `default-features = false, features = ["rustls-no-provider",
    "http2", "json", "charset"]` so it reuses the **ring** provider we install at
    runtime rather than forcing aws-lc-rs (cmake+nasm we lack — D10). `cargo tree`
    confirms no aws-lc-sys/aws-lc-rs. `ensure_ring_provider` made `pub(crate)` and
    shared with the gateway HTTP client. serde added for the typed reply struct.
  - `lib.rs`: `## Hosted gateways` doc section; `pub mod gateway`; re-exports
    `AcquiredSession`, `browserbase`, `cloudflare`, `GatewayError`.
  - New gated `observe_hosted` example: picks a provider from env, mints/derives
    the `wss://` URL, asserts the URL shape, prints it **with the credential
    redacted** + a replay link; prints usage and exits 0 with no creds (CI-safe).
  - 12 new unit tests over the pure functions (URL build, query-encode, body
    shape, reply parse incl. missing-field error, snippet truncation incl.
    multi-byte boundary). The network call is gated behind the example, matching
    the `observe_wss` / `observe_rerender` CI-safe pattern.
  - **Live proof:** ran `observe_hosted` against real Browserbase several times —
    minted live sessions every run (e.g. `ea8a83d6-…`), returned
    `wss://connect.usw2.browserbase.com/?signingKey=…` + replay link, exit 0.
    Empirical: the current Browserbase `connectUrl` carries the credential as
    `signingKey`, not the `apiKey` the older docs showed — the helper is agnostic
    and returns whatever `connectUrl` the API gives.
- **Judgment call / what I deliberately did NOT do (D19):** I attempted to wire
  the full hosted connect+rebind leg and hit a real chromiumoxide 0.9.1 wall —
  it cannot cleanly attach to the page a hosted browser already has open
  (`new_page` panics on the `createTarget`/`targetCreated` race at
  `handler/mod.rs:208`; `fetch_targets` attaches a non-flat session that fails
  `-32001` and gets cached permanently by `get_or_create_page`; discovery-only
  fires no `targetCreated` for the pre-existing page within 5s). There is no
  `HandlerConfig` lever for flat auto-attach. Rather than patch the dependency or
  ship a half-working connect path, I **reverted `connect()` to its proven
  local-`ws://` `new_page` form (unchanged, run-4 proof intact)**, shipped the
  live-verified acquire leg alone, and recorded the connect leg as D19 with the
  exact crate line numbers and three ranked fix paths for the next increment.
  One polished, live-verified increment over a sprawling broken one.
- VERIFY: `cargo test --workspace` = **81 passing** (36 core + 41 cdp + 2
  integration + 2 doctests); the 12 new gateway tests `... ok`. `cargo clippy
  --all-targets` clean under `-D warnings` (compiled the new example + reqwest/
  serde). `cargo fmt --all -- --check` clean.
- Commit sha: see the commit that lands this entry. **Phase 3.1 acquire leg done
  and live-proven; connect leg is D19, the next increment.**

## Builder run 12 — Phase 3.1b: the hosted connect leg (D19 → D20) — 2026-06-17

- TARGET: ROADMAP 3.1b. Drive the full observe→rebind loop against the page a
  hosted browser *already has open*, over an acquired `wss://`, resolving the D19
  block exactly as D20 specified — a self-contained thin CDP channel behind the
  existing `ObservationSource` seam, **no chromiumoxide bump, no fork**.
- BUILT:
  - New `channel.rs` (~470 lines). The seam is a **sealed** `pub trait CdpChannel`
    with one method: `fn run<T: Command>(&self, cmd: T) -> impl Future<Output =
    Result<T::Response, CdpError>> + Send`. Implemented for both `Page` (delegates
    to the existing `Page::execute`, so the local path is byte-identical) and the
    new `RawCdpSession` (the flat transport).
  - `RawCdpSession { ws: Mutex<WebSocketStream<ConnectStream>>, session_id, next_id:
    AtomicU64 }`. `connect_hosted(ws_url)` connects the `wss://` (1.5b already
    brought async-tungstenite + rustls/ring into the tree), issues
    `Target.attachToTarget { flatten: true }` once, captures the returned
    `sessionId`, and routes every later command as a flat envelope
    `{id, method, params, sessionId}` over the one multiplexed WebSocket, matching
    replies by numeric `id` and ignoring event frames (no `id`). The typed
    `chromiumoxide_cdp` `Command` structs are reused for (de)serialization — no
    hand-rolled wire types.
  - `HostedSession { observer: CdpObserver<RawCdpSession> }` with `navigate`/
    `evaluate` convenience plus the shared `observer`. Pure helpers `build_envelope`,
    `response_for`, `select_page_target` carry the wire-format bug surface as 9 new
    unit tests.
  - `observer.rs` refactor: `CdpObserver` made generic — `CdpObserver<C = Page>` —
    so the ENTIRE fusion/listener/decode pipeline (`attach`, `listener_roles`,
    `raw_pass`, the `ObservationSource` impl) is shared across both transports.
    Every `self.page.execute(X).await?.result.Y` became `self.channel.run(X).await?.Y`.
    `impl CdpObserver<Page>` keeps a `page()` accessor; `Session` still holds
    `CdpObserver` (defaulting to `<Page>`), so `connect()` is behaviorally unchanged
    (run-4 local proof intact).
  - `lib.rs`: `pub mod channel`, re-exports `HostedSession`/`RawCdpSession`/
    `connect_hosted`, and a `## The hosted connect leg` doc section.
  - `Cargo.toml`: tokio gains the `sync` feature (for the `Mutex` guarding the WS).
  - New gated `connect_hosted` example mirrors `observe_rerender` over the hosted
    leg: Browserbase creds win if both set, else local `ANCHORTREE_CDP_WS`/`_HTTP`,
    else prints usage and exits 0 (CI-safe). Drives observe → innerHTML swap →
    observe (asserts all eids rebound, none added/removed) → in-place text edit →
    observe (asserts the cheap changed path, nothing rebinds).
- JUDGMENT CALLS:
  - **Sealed the trait.** `CdpObserver<C>` is public and bound by `CdpChannel`, so
    `private_bounds` would fire if `CdpChannel` stayed `pub(crate)`. Making it `pub`
    + sealing (`mod sealed` with `Sealed` impls for `Page` and `RawCdpSession`)
    satisfies the lint while keeping the trait unimplementable downstream.
  - **`#[allow(clippy::manual_async_fn)]` on both `run` impls is required, not
    laziness.** The explicit `-> impl Future + Send` return is load-bearing: an
    `async fn` in a trait does not carry the `+ Send` bound, and without it the
    generic `ObservationSource::observe` (which awaits `channel.run`) stops being
    `Send`. The allow is annotated with that reason at each site.
  - **Removed the unused `SinkExt` import.** `.send()` on the WS sink resolves and
    type-checks via the `map_err(ws_error)` path without the trait in scope; CI
    denies warnings, so the import had to go. Kept only `use futures::StreamExt as _;`.
  - **Did NOT reuse `chromiumoxide::Page` and did NOT fork** (D20). The two preferred
    D19 paths are both unreachable (newest crate is `0.9.1` with no relevant `main`
    movement; `PageInner` is crate-private and `Browser::execute` is sessionless).
    The thin channel confines all hosted plumbing behind the trait the core already
    depends on.
- VERIFY: `cargo test --workspace` = **89 passing** (36 core + 49 cdp + 2
  integration + 2 doctests); the 9 new channel tests `... ok`. `cargo clippy
  --all-targets` clean under `-D warnings`. `cargo fmt --all -- --check` clean.
- LIVE PROOF (both transports, same flat-attach path):
  - Local `ws://` `chromedp/headless-shell`: flat-attached to the page the browser
    ALREADY had open (first-observe backendNodeIds 3–6 prove it was not freshly
    created), all 4 eids rebound across the innerHTML swap (3→16, 4→17, 5→18, 6→19),
    in-place text edit landed on the cheap changed path.
  - Real Browserbase `wss://` (session `1fdeb2f2-c022-43e1-ab52-dfb907e0ab01`): same
    full acquire→connect→observe→rebind loop, rebind ledger 10→19, 11→20, 12→21,
    13→22. Exit 0.
- Commit sha: see the commit that lands this entry. **Phase 3.1 is complete end to
  end; D19 + D20 confirmed. Next: 3.2 multi-frame identity or the 3.3 benchmark.**

## Builder run 13 — Phase 3.2a: same-origin multi-frame identity (D21 mechanics 1+2+4) — 2026-06-17

- GOAL: ship the same-origin slice of D21 (two-tier durable identity), deferring
  the cross-origin OOPIF slice (mechanics 3+5) to 3.2b. The thesis test: two
  structurally identical widgets in two different frames must hold *distinct*
  durable eids and rebind *independently*, proving the eid is `(frame, in-frame
  fingerprint)` and not fingerprint alone.
- SLICE DECISION (judgment call): D21 lists five mechanics. 1 (two-tier eid),
  2 (same-origin frames), and 4 (resolve-map re-key) are a self-contained,
  live-verifiable unit that needs no new CDP session. 3 (OOPIF auto-attach) and
  5 (owning-session action dispatch) require extending the run-12 thin channel
  from 1 session to N and threading an owning-session handle through
  observe→resolve→act — a larger, separable arc. Shipping 1+2+4 now lands a real,
  provable capability (same-origin iframe identity, the common case) without
  half-building the OOPIF path. One polished increment over two sloppy ones.
- BUILT (core, browser-free):
  - New `FrameKey(String)` type: `root()` = empty, `child(ordinal)` builds the
    dot-joined ordinal path (`"0"`, `"0.1"`), `is_root()`/Display. The frame's
    *structural* identity, durable across reloads (a reload reassigns the volatile
    `frameId` but "the login iframe" keeps its ordinal path).
  - `ObservedNode` and `Binding` both gained `frame_key`. The resolve map re-keyed
    `by_backend: HashMap<(FrameKey, BackendNodeId), Eid>`. All three resolution
    paths (soft backend match, fingerprint rebind, mint) are now frame-scoped:
    `best_rebind` skips candidates in a different frame; `mint` namespaces non-root
    eids `f<key>/<local>`; the disambiguation counter is per-frame.
  - 4 new core tests: ordinal-path construction, distinct eids cross-frame,
    independent rebind, per-frame disambiguation counter.
- BUILT (cdp adapter):
  - New browser-free `frames.rs`: `frame_keys` (walk `getFrameTree` → structural
    keys), `map_backends_to_frames` (walk pierced DOM → `backend→FrameKey`, iframe
    owner attributed to parent frame, its `contentDocument` subtree to the child),
    `same_origin_frame_ids` (collect inline-document frame ids in document order).
    6 unit tests, no browser.
  - `fuse` threads a `frame_of: &HashMap<i64, FrameKey>` and stamps each node.
  - `observer.rs` `raw_pass` rewired: fetch pierced `getDocument` + `getFrameTree`
    first (primes the DOM agent AND yields the frame map), then the AX trees.
- DISCOVERY / CORRECTION to D21 mechanic 2 (the run's real finding): the live
  example first failed because only the *root* button was observed. A debug dump
  proved `getFullAXTree` with no frameId returns ONLY the root frame's AX nodes
  (1 node) — it stops at every frame boundary. So same-origin frames are free from
  the pierced *DOM* pass (the `backend→FrameKey` map IS derivable from the inline
  `content_document` subtrees) but NOT from the *AX* pass. Fix: the observer now
  issues one `getFullAXTree(frameId)` per same-origin frame (ids from
  `same_origin_frame_ids`) and concatenates the nodes. Backend ids are unique
  across the root target's pierced id space, so the merge cannot collide and the
  frame map attributes each merged node correctly. This is the kind of thing only
  a live run surfaces — the unit tests were green while the pipeline was blind to
  the frame.
- VERIFY: `cargo test --workspace` = **99 passing** (40 core + 55 cdp + 2
  integration + 2 doctests). `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` clean.
  `cargo fmt --all -- --check` clean.
- LIVE PROOF (`examples/observe_frames.rs` against `chromedp/headless-shell`): a
  root `<main><button id=act>` and an identical button inside a same-origin
  `srcdoc` iframe. Observation 1 minted BOTH `btn-action` (root) and
  `f0/btn-action` (frame) — distinct eids for byte-identical widgets, separated
  only by frame. Observation 2 re-rendered the iframe's inner DOM only; the diff
  rebound EXACTLY `f0/btn-action` (backendNodeId 15→17) and added/removed nothing,
  while the root `btn-action` stayed steady on backendNodeId 8. Exit 0. This is
  the live proof of D21's first tier.
- Commit sha: see the commit that lands this entry. **Phase 3.2a complete and
  live-verified. Next: 3.2b OOPIF (mechanics 3+5) or the 3.3 benchmark harness.**

## Builder run 14 — Phase 3.2b: cross-origin OOPIF channel + join (D22 steps 1-3, step 3 amended) — 2026-06-17

- SCOPE (judgment call): D22's OOPIF leg is five mechanics. I scoped this run to
  the load-bearing infrastructure — the multi-session channel, the auto-attach
  event drain, and the durable frame-key ↔ child-session join — plus a live
  micro-proof. Per-child observe (mechanic 4) and dispatch on the owning session
  (mechanic 5) are now their own roadmap item 3.2c. Reason: the join is the part
  D22 said "must be asserted live, not trusted blind", and it is the part most
  likely to surface a wrong assumption. It did. Building observe+dispatch on top
  of an unproven join would have been three sloppy mechanics instead of one
  polished one.
- BUILT (channel, `channel.rs`): `RawCdpSession::run_on(session_id, cmd)` holds the
  full write+read loop; the `run` trait method delegates to it with the page
  session, so the run-12 single-session fast path is byte-identical.
  `auto_attach_children()` issues `setAutoAttach{autoAttach,flatten,
  !waitForDebugger}` and drains `Target.attachedToTarget` events into
  `ChildSession{session_id,target_id,target_type}` until the command ack `id`
  arrives (the read side already demuxes by `id`, so no demux change). Free
  function `parse_attached_to_target` keeps the wire-shape parse unit-testable
  without a socket. Used the inherent const `SetAutoAttachParams::IDENTIFIER`
  rather than `cmd.identifier()` — the `Method` trait is not in scope for the
  concrete param type.
- BUILT (join, `frames.rs`): `child_frame_keys(children, table)` joins
  `child.target_id -> structural FrameKey`. `dom_frame_keys(root)` derives the key
  table from the pierced DOM in document order, numbering every iframe owner
  (same-origin OR OOPIF) by its position in its containing document. It agrees
  with `frame_keys`/getFrameTree on every same-origin frame and additionally keys
  OOPIF owners, which getFrameTree omits.
- BUILT (wiring): `HostedSession::frame_keys()` now reads
  `getDocument{depth:-1,pierce:true}` and runs `dom_frame_keys` (was
  `getFrameTree` + `frame_keys`). `decode_dom_node` made `pub(crate)` so the
  channel can reuse the observer's decoder. `dom_frame_keys` re-exported from
  `lib.rs`. New gated example `attach_oopif`.
- DISCOVERY / CORRECTION to D22 step 3 (the run's real finding): the live example
  first failed because `child_frame_keys` fed a getFrameTree-derived table came
  back empty for the OOPIF. Raw-CDP probes against the same
  `--site-per-process` Chrome proved why: a cross-origin OOPIF's frame is ABSENT
  from the root target's `Page.getFrameTree`, before AND after `setAutoAttach`.
  The OOPIF's owner `<iframe>` element IS in the root pierced DOM, carrying
  `frameId` == the child target's `targetId`, but with its `contentDocument`
  stripped (the very reason `same_origin_frame_ids` already skips it).
  `Target.attachedToTarget` carries `targetInfo.parentFrameId` (parent link) and
  `targetId` (child's own frameId). So the structural key must come from DOM
  document order, not the frame tree. `child_frame_keys`'s signature was already
  right; only its input table was wrong. Amended D22 in DECISIONS.md; `parentFrameId`
  is captured-but-unneeded, so `ChildSession` deliberately omits a redundant
  parent field — the join needs only `target_id -> dom_frame_keys`. This is the
  kind of thing only a live run surfaces: every unit test was green while the
  pipeline's source table was structurally incapable of holding an OOPIF.
- VERIFY: `cargo test --workspace` = **108 passing** (40 core + 64 cdp + 2
  integration + 2 doctests). `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` clean.
  `cargo fmt --all -- --check` clean.
- LIVE PROOF (`examples/attach_oopif` against `chromedp/headless-shell
  --site-per-process`, parent on network alias origin-a embedding a genuinely
  cross-origin iframe on origin-b): the DOM-derived frame table keyed two frames
  (`F710… -> 0`, `6747… -> 1`); auto-attach announced one iframe child session
  whose target id `6747…` joined to the non-root durable frame key `1`. Exit 0.
  The OOPIF's separate CDP target carries the same durable identity the engine
  namespaces its in-frame elements under — D22 step 3 (amended) confirmed live.
- Commit sha: see the commit that lands this entry. **Phase 3.2b (OOPIF channel +
  join) complete and live-verified. Next: 3.2c per-OOPIF observe + dispatch
  (mechanics 4+5) or the 3.3 benchmark harness.**

## Builder run 15 — Phase 3.2c: per-OOPIF observe (D23 mechanic 4) — 2026-06-17

- SCOPE: turn the run-14 OOPIF *channel* into an OOPIF *observation*. After this
  run, `observe()` returns one flat `Vec<ObservedNode>` in which a cross-origin
  OOPIF's widget carries a durable, frame-namespaced eid and rebinds across a
  re-render — the same contract the engine already gives root + same-origin nodes.
- BUILT (channel promotion, `channel.rs`): moved `run_on` and
  `auto_attach_children` from inherent methods on `RawCdpSession` onto the
  `CdpChannel` **trait** as default methods (`run_on → run`, `auto_attach_children
  → Ok(vec![])`), and converted the `RawCdpSession` bodies to trait-method
  overrides. RPITIT means the defaults are `-> impl Future + Send` with
  `#[allow(clippy::manual_async_fn)]` + `async move` bodies (the `+ Send` bound is
  load-bearing; `async fn` in a trait does not carry it). `Page` now inherits the
  no-op OOPIF path with a byte-identical local fast path, so the run-4/12/13 proofs
  do not regress.
- BUILT (observe fold, `observer.rs`): `raw_pass` now returns a `Vec<FramePass>`
  (a new module struct: `ax`, `attrs`, `layout`, `listener_roles`, `frame_map`).
  The root pass is built as before; `observe_oopif_children` then drains
  `auto_attach_children()`, refreshes a persistent `oopif_sessions` cache
  (target→session), and for each cached child whose target id is a known
  `dom_frame_keys` frame key, runs `child_pass`: enable AX+DOM on the child
  session, `getDocument(pierce)` to prime its DOM agent, `getFullAXTree`,
  `attrs_and_layout` over `run_sel`, and stamp every AX node's backend with the
  child's `FrameKey`. `observe` fuses **each `FramePass` independently and
  concatenates** the results.
- JUDGMENT CALL (the D23 collision resolution, refined live): D23 floated
  remapping child `backendNodeId`s into a disjoint synthetic range to avoid
  cross-target collisions under `--site-per-process` (a child target's
  `backendNodeId` AND `AXNodeId` spaces can both collide with root's). Reading
  `identity.rs` showed the core already keys its fast path `by_backend` on
  `(FrameKey, BackendNodeId)` (`:133`, used `:214`/`:244`), and `fuse` keys its
  structural walk on per-target `AXNodeId` strings — so fusing each session's pass
  **separately** and concatenating the `Vec<ObservedNode>` sidesteps BOTH
  collisions with ZERO remapping: every fuse call lives in one session's isolated
  id space, and the child nodes carry the OOPIF's `FrameKey`. Simpler and more
  robust than the remap. A new unit test in `fuse.rs`
  (`oopif_and_root_nodes_with_colliding_backends_keep_distinct_identities`) is the
  regression guard: two buttons share backend id 1 across two frame keys and still
  resolve to two distinct eids, one `f0/`-namespaced.
- DEFERRALS (documented, not silent): listener-role inference *inside* an OOPIF
  (child pass uses an empty `ListenerRoles`); and frames nested *inside* an OOPIF
  (one level only). Both are 3.2d-or-later scope.
- VERIFY: `cargo test --workspace` = **109 passing** (40 core + 65 cdp + 2
  integration + 2 doctests, +1 from the collision test). `cargo clippy
  --all-targets -- -D warnings` clean. `cargo fmt --all -- --check` clean.
- LIVE PROOF (`examples/observe_oopif`, new gated example, against
  `chromedp/headless-shell --site-per-process`; parent on alias origin-a embeds a
  genuinely cross-origin iframe on origin-b whose `child.html` swaps its widget's
  `innerHTML` ~1.2s after load): first `observe()` surfaced the OOPIF button as
  `f1/btn-buy-now` (frame-namespaced) and the root button as `btn-save-document`
  (root); after the swap the second `observe()` reported `f1/btn-buy-now` in
  `diff.rebound` with a fresh backend node (9 → 15), never removed/added. Exit 0.
  The second pass also implicitly confirmed the `oopif_sessions` cache: Chrome
  announces a child once, yet the second pass still reached the child session and
  read its new backend.
- LIVE FINDING (open question, NOT a 3.2c regression): the sole cross-origin
  iframe keyed as frame `"1"`, not `"0"` — a phantom `"0"` entry keyed by the main
  frame's id precedes it (visible in run-14's `attach_oopif` ledger too). The
  decoded `getDocument(pierce).root` evidently carries the main frame's
  `#document` as a *counted* descendant, so `dom_frame_keys`'s `assign_dom_frames`
  treats it as an iframe owner at ordinal 0. Identity is still durable, unique, and
  rebinds correctly, so this is cosmetic-but-wrong, not a correctness break. A
  clean fix needs `DomNode` to carry `node_type`/`node_name` so a `#document`
  (nodeType 9) is distinguishable from an `<iframe>` owner — a focused follow-up
  touching the 3.2a `decode_dom_node` foundation, deliberately not folded into
  3.2c. Logged in STATE Open questions for the research cron.
- Commit sha: see the commit that lands this entry. **Phase 3.2c (per-OOPIF
  observe) complete and live-verified. Next: 3.2d per-OOPIF dispatch (channelize
  `actions.rs`), then the 3.3 benchmark harness arc.**

## Builder run 16 — Phase 3.2c.1: frame-key correctness via a node-*name* owner guard (D24, corrected) — 2026-06-17

- GOAL: the top unchecked ROADMAP item, 3.2c.1. On the live `--site-per-process`
  page the sole cross-origin OOPIF keyed frame `"1"` not `"0"` — a phantom `"0"`
  preceded it. The proposed fix (D24, research run 15) was a node-*type* guard:
  add `node_type: i64` to `DomNode`, gate the owner branch on `node_type == 1`
  (ELEMENT_NODE), on the theory the phantom is the main frame's `#document`
  (nodeType 9) carrying a `frameId`.
- FALSIFIED LIVE (the run's pivot). I implemented the node-type guard; all unit
  tests passed (111 green) but `examples/observe_oopif` STILL keyed `f1/`.
  Instrumenting `assign_dom_frames` showed two frame-id carriers, **both
  nodeType 1**. A direct CDP dump (`DOM.getDocument{depth:-1,pierce:true}` +
  `Page.getFrameTree`, written as a one-off `ws` client) pinned it exactly:
  ```
  getFrameTree: d0 id=DCD662EE… url=…/parent.html        (the MAIN frame)
  frameId=DCD662EE…  nodeName=HTML    nodeType=1  backend=32  path=#document>HTML
  frameId=B83E3EF3…  nodeName=IFRAME  nodeType=1  backend=42  path=#document>HTML>BODY>IFRAME
  ```
  CDP stamps `frameId` on the `<html>` **document element** of every frame (it
  carries the frame's *own* id, here the main frame), not on a `#document` node —
  and the `#document` root carried no `frameId` at all. The `<html>` and the real
  `<iframe>` are both nodeType 1, so node-type cannot separate them. The D24
  theory was wrong; the spec line "frameId is set for frame owner elements and the
  document node" read at face value misled the diagnosis.
- SHIPPED FIX (the correct discriminator is the node *name*). Only an
  `<iframe>`/`<frame>` element owns a *child* browsing context; the `<html>`
  document element never does. Replaced `node_type: i64` with `node_name: String`
  on `DomNode` (`frames.rs`), populate it in `decode_dom_node` from
  `node.node_name` (`observer.rs`), and gate the owner branch on
  `is_frame_owner_element(&child.node_name)` (case-insensitive `iframe`/`frame`).
  The struct doc comment and the load-bearing-guard comment were rewritten to the
  corrected mechanism. The two regression tests now model the `<html>`-element
  phantom via a new `html_doc_element(frame_id, children)` test helper (node_name
  "HTML") rather than a `#document` node: `…ignore_the_html_element_carrying_its_
  own_frame_id` and `…number_owners_across_a_nested_html_element`.
- VERIFY: `cargo test` (workspace) = **111 passing** (40 core + 67 cdp + 2
  integration + 2 doctests; +2 cdp from the two corrected regression tests).
  `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` clean. `cargo fmt --all -- --check`
  clean.
- LIVE PROOF (`examples/observe_oopif`, same `chromedp/headless-shell
  --site-per-process` + two-origin static server as run 15): first `observe()`
  surfaced the OOPIF button as **`f0/btn-buy-now`** (was `f1/`) and the root button
  as `btn-save-document`; after the in-OOPIF `innerHTML` swap the second
  `observe()` reported `f0/btn-buy-now` in `diff.rebound` with a fresh backend
  (9 → 13), never removed/added. Exit 0. The example assertion was tightened to
  `starts_with("f0/")`, so the phantom cannot silently return.
- DECISIONS: D24 header flipped PROPOSED→ACCEPTED; the falsified node-type body is
  preserved with an appended "Falsification + corrected fix (builder run 16)"
  block carrying the live CDP dump, the corrected mechanism, and the lesson (dump
  the real tree before trusting a spec-derived discriminator).
- Commit sha: see the commit that lands this entry. **Phase 3.2c.1 complete and
  live-verified; the OOPIF keys `f0/`. Next: 3.2d per-OOPIF dispatch (channelize
  `actions.rs` from `&Page` to `&impl CdpChannel`), then the 3.3 benchmark arc.**

## Builder run 17 — Phase 3.2d: per-OOPIF dispatch (channelize actions.rs, route eid to owning session; D22/D23 dispatch half) — 2026-06-17

- TASK (ROADMAP 3.2d, mechanic 5): route an OOPIF eid to its owning child session.
  D23 flagged this as bigger than it reads: `actions.rs` was `chromiumoxide::Page`-
  only (`act(page: &Page, …)`) with no channel-based action path, so the dispatch
  could only ever hit the page session. First channelize, then route.
- BUILD step 1 — channelize `actions.rs`. Every entry point and helper went from
  `&Page` to `<C: CdpChannel>` plus an explicit `session: Option<&str>`:
  `act`, `act_mark`, `act_on_backend`, `click`, `type_text`, `select_value`,
  `call_on_backend`. Every `page.execute(cmd).await?.result` became
  `chan.run_on(session, cmd).await?` — `run_on` already unwraps the
  `CommandResponse` envelope, so the `.result` field access dropped everywhere
  (`quads.result.quads` → `quads.quads`; `resolved.result.object` → `resolved.object`).
  `Runtime.resolveNode` (in `call_on_backend`) and the `Input`/`DOM` click/type/select
  dispatch now all flow through the channel with the owning session tagged on.
- BUILD step 2 — routing table on `CdpObserver`. Added
  `frame_sessions: HashMap<FrameKey, String>` alongside the existing
  `oopif_sessions: HashMap<String, String>`. It is the D23 dispatch table: rebuilt
  every pass in `observe_oopif_children` (cleared up front, before the
  `oopif_sessions.is_empty()` early return; one insert per live OOPIF child session
  keyed by its durable `FrameKey`; removed on a child-pass `Err`). It holds **OOPIF
  frames only** — a lookup miss is the correct signal for "root or in-process iframe",
  which dispatches on the page session (`None`).
- BUILD step 3 — routed surface. Two new methods on `CdpObserver`:
  `act(&self, map, eid, action)` reads the eid's frame off its live binding
  (`session_for_binding` → `frame_sessions.get(frame_key)`) and calls the channelized
  `actions::act` with that session; `act_mark(&self, obs, index, action)` dispatches on
  the page session (`None`) — a `Mark` carries only a `backend_node_id` and no
  `FrameKey`, so OOPIF mark routing is out of scope and correctly defaults to root.
  The two live examples (`act_on_mark`, `act_after_rerender`) were moved onto these
  routed methods (they no longer import the free `act`/`act_mark`).
- JUDGMENT CALLS:
  - `ActError::Cdp` now wraps `crate::error::CdpError` (`#[from]`), not
    `chromiumoxide::error::CdpError`. `run_on` returns the crate error already, so the
    `?` conversions only compile against the crate type; the chromiumoxide import was
    dropped. This is the natural consequence of channelizing — the actions layer no
    longer speaks raw chromiumoxide errors.
  - **Fixtures committed into the repo** under `examples/fixtures/oopif/`
    (`parent.html`/`child.html` for the observe/rebind demos, `parent_action.html`/
    `child_action.html` for the action demo). Prior runs reconstructed these by hand
    each teardown; committing them makes the OOPIF examples reproducible from a clean
    checkout (the README env recipe points at them).
  - **role=status was the wrong observable signal** (caught live). The first
    `child_action.html` revealed a hidden `<p role="status">Purchased</p>` on click; the
    re-observe reported `added=[]` and the assert panicked. Two reasons, both worth
    keeping: (1) a `role="status"` container's accessible **name is empty** — its text
    becomes a child `StaticText` node, not the container's name; (2) a text/state change
    reports into `diff.changed`, **not** `diff.added` (confirmed against
    `identity.rs:282-315`, where `update_binding` always refreshes `fingerprint`). Fix:
    relabel the **button's own text** on click (`buy.textContent = …`), since a button's
    accessible name *is* its text content, and read
    `map.binding(&eid).fingerprint.accessible_name` directly after re-observe rather than
    scanning the diff. The label is gated on `event.isTrusted`, so the observed name
    (`"Purchased"` vs `"Untrusted click"`) is itself the proof the click arrived trusted.
- VERIFY: `cargo test` (workspace) = **111 passing** (40 core + 67 cdp + 2 integration
  + 2 doctests; the 7 actions unit tests are unchanged — the channelization is a
  type-parameter lift, not a behavior change). `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`
  clean. `cargo fmt --all -- --check` clean.
- LIVE PROOF (`examples/act_oopif`, same `chromedp/headless-shell --site-per-process`
  + two-origin static server harness as runs 14-16): navigate `parent_action.html`,
  first `observe()` surfaces the OOPIF button as **`f0/btn-buy-now`** (non-root frame
  key, name `"Buy now"`); routed `session.observer.act(&map, &buy_eid, Action::Click)`
  resolves the owning child session and dispatches the trusted pointer gesture there;
  second `observe()` reports the same eid, still under a non-root frame key, with
  accessible name **`"Purchased"`** — which can only happen if the click reached the
  right node, in the right frame, and arrived trusted. Exit 0.
- DECISIONS: D22 and the dispatch half of D23 are now closed (the read half closed in
  run 15). See DECISIONS.md.
- Commit sha: see the commit that lands this entry. **Phase 3.2d complete and
  live-verified; an OOPIF eid routes to its owning session for both read and write.
  Multi-frame identity (3.2a–3.2d) is done end to end. Next: 3.3 benchmark harness.**

## Build run 18 — 2026-06-17 — Phase 3.3a HAR recorder (network.har from CDP Network.* events)

- ROADMAP ITEM: **3.3a HAR recorder** (FIRST item under Phase 3.3, the critical
  path for the WebArena-Verified evaluator). Record a `network.har` from CDP
  `Network.*` events, hermetic and unit-testable against synthetic events, **no
  WebArena dependency** so it cannot be blocked by harness setup.
- WHAT WAS BUILT: a new `crates/anchortree-cdp/src/har.rs` (~940 lines) plus the
  `pub mod har;` + re-export block in `lib.rs`. The core is `HarRecorder`, a **pure
  state machine** keyed by `requestId` with no browser, async, or IO in the recording
  path. It folds the four correlated CDP events into HAR 1.2 entries:
  - `on_request_will_be_sent` opens a `Pending` (captures the `Request`, the wall
    `startedDateTime`, and the monotonic start). If the event carries a
    `redirect_response` for an id already pending, it **finalizes the previous hop as
    its own entry first** (redirect reuse of one requestId → one entry per hop) before
    opening the fresh `Pending`. Uses an edition-2024 let-chain.
  - `on_response_received` attaches the `Response` + `serverIPAddress`.
  - `on_loading_finished` finalizes with `bodySize = encodedDataLength`.
  - `on_loading_failed` finalizes with status 0 and an `_error` field.
  - `into_har` drains any still-in-flight `Pending` **sorted by monotonic start**
    (deterministic output) with `time = -1`, and emits a `version: "1.2"` log.
  - Serialization types (`Har`/`HarLog`/`HarEntry`/`HarRequest`/`HarResponse`/…)
    are `#[derive(Serialize)]` with the exact HAR camelCase / `startedDateTime` /
    `serverIPAddress` / `redirectURL` field names. `Har::to_json()` pretty-prints.
  - `enable<C: CdpChannel>(chan, session)` is the only live surface — it issues
    `Network.enable` through `run_on` so the recorder can later be fed a live stream.
- VERIFY: `cargo test` (workspace) = **124 passing** (40 core + 80 cdp + 2 integration
  + 2 doctests; +13 new `har` unit tests). `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`
  clean. `cargo fmt --all -- --check` clean.
- TESTS (13, all synthetic — no browser): epoch-zero / known-epoch
  (`1_700_000_000.0` → `"2023-11-14T22:13:20.000Z"`) / fractional-seconds /
  millisecond-rounding-carry / leap-year-boundary ISO-8601 conversions;
  query-string parse; HTTP-version normalize (`h2`→`HTTP/2`); header decode;
  full request→response→finish makes exactly one entry; redirect chain yields one
  entry per hop; failed request records an error entry; in-flight requests flush in
  start order; emitted HAR is valid round-trippable JSON.
- JUDGMENT CALLS:
  - **Live event-subscription wiring is deferred to 3.3b on purpose.** 3.3a is scoped
    "hermetic, unit-testable against synthetic events, no WebArena dependency." The
    recorder takes already-decoded CDP event structs; subscribing the channel's event
    stream and pumping it into the recorder needs a live browser to record against,
    which is exactly what the 3.3b task-runner provides. Keeping the subscription out
    of 3.3a keeps every test browser-free and keeps the critical-path deliverable
    unblockable by harness setup.
  - **Dependency-free ISO-8601** via Howard Hinnant's `civil_from_days` rather than
    adding `chrono`/`time`. The HAR `startedDateTime` is the only date surface in the
    crate; a ~20-line public-domain algorithm is a better trade than a transitive
    dependency on the critical path. Covered by 5 conversion tests incl. a leap-year
    boundary and millisecond carry.
  - **Timing reported entirely under `wait`.** CDP `Network.*` events don't expose the
    sub-phase breakdown (blocked/dns/connect/send/receive) without the optional
    `Network.getResponseBody`/timing extras. Rather than invent fake sub-phases,
    `HarTimings::with_total` puts the whole measured duration under `wait` and zeroes
    `send`/`receive`, preserving the HAR invariant `time == blocked+dns+connect+send+
    wait+receive` (and `-1` for everything when the duration is unknown). The evaluator
    reads totals, not sub-phases, so this is lossless for our consumer.
  - **CDP newtype accessors** (`RequestId::inner`, `MonotonicTime::inner`,
    `TimeSinceEpoch::inner`, `Headers::inner`) — all fields are private in
    chromiumoxide_cdp 0.9.1; the `inner()`/`AsRef` accessors are the supported reads,
    no fork needed.
- DECISIONS: D25's 3.3a half is now confirmed (see DECISIONS.md).
- Commit sha: see the commit that lands this entry. **Phase 3.3a complete and fully
  hermetic; the WebArena-Verified evaluator's `network.har` input now has a producer.
  Next: 3.3b task-runner skeleton + `agent_response.json`, which wires this recorder
  to a live CDP event stream against one Verified RETRIEVE task.**

## Build run 19 — 2026-06-17 — Phase 3.3b (i + ii): live NetworkCapture pump + agent_response.json emitter

- ROADMAP ITEM: **3.3b task-runner skeleton + `agent_response.json` emitter**,
  shape pinned by **D26**. This run lands sub-steps **(i)** the live
  `Page`-event → `HarRecorder` pump and **(ii)** the `agent_response.json` writer.
  Sub-step **(iii)** (the offline-replay eval-assertion) is deliberately deferred
  — see judgment calls.
- WHAT WAS BUILT: a new `crates/anchortree-cdp/src/runner.rs` plus the `pub mod
  runner;` + re-export block in `lib.rs`, and a live proof example
  `examples/webarena_capture.rs`.
  - `NetworkCapture::start(page: &Page)` subscribes the four `Network.*` event
    streams via `Page::event_listener::<T>()` (each `EventStream<T>: Stream<Item =
    Arc<T>>`), tags each into a `NetEvent` enum, merges them with two nested
    `stream::select`s into one `BoxStream<'static, NetEvent>`, enables Network,
    and spawns a background Tokio task that folds every event into a `HarRecorder`.
    Per **D26** this rides the local `chromiumoxide::Page` path, NOT the thin
    `RawCdpSession` channel — the channel read loop drains and discards events, so
    it is not an event tap.
  - The pump avoids the `select!` macro (the lib pulls only tokio `rt`+`sync`, no
    `macros`): it folds the `oneshot` stop signal into the same stream as the
    events via `stream::once(...).map(|()| Control::Stop)` + `stream::select`, then
    on `Stop` drains already-queued events with `next().now_or_never()` before
    finishing. Clean, macro-free, and deterministic.
  - `NetworkCapture::finish()` sends the stop, awaits the pump task, and returns
    `recorder.into_har()`. A join failure maps to `CdpError::Malformed`.
  - Agent contract output: `TaskType` (RETRIEVE/MUTATE/NAVIGATE) and `TaskStatus`
    (SUCCESS/NOT_FOUND_ERROR/PERMISSION_DENIED_ERROR), both
    `#[serde(rename_all = "SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE")]`; `AgentResponse {task_type,
    status, retrieved_data: Option<Value>, error_details: Option<String>}` with all
    four keys always emitted (absent optionals serialize as `null`, since the
    runner reads by fixed key); constructors `retrieved`/`completed`/`failed`;
    `write_task_output(dir, &resp, &har)` writes `agent_response.json` +
    `network.har` (exact filenames, `create_dir_all` first).
- VERIFY: `cargo test` (workspace) = **128 passing** (40 core + 84 cdp + 2
  integration + 2 doctests; +4 new `runner` unit tests; the new `///` example is a
  `ignore` doctest, counted ignored not passing). `cargo clippy --all-targets --
  -D warnings` clean. `cargo fmt --all -- --check` clean.
- TESTS (4 hermetic, no browser): `AgentResponse` RETRIEVE serializes with
  `RETRIEVE`/`SUCCESS`/data present/`error_details` null; failed serializes
  `NOT_FOUND_ERROR` + details + null data; completed MUTATE has null data and null
  error; `write_task_output` emits both exact filenames, both valid JSON, the HAR
  round-trips to a 1.2 log (dependency-free unique temp dir, cleaned up after).
- LIVE PROOF (`examples/webarena_capture`, exit 0): local `chromedp/headless-shell`
  + a `python -m http.server` static site (files pushed in with `docker cp` — a
  bind-mount of the phantom container's `/tmp` does NOT work, the host has no such
  path; this bit once mid-run and the server 404'd until the `docker cp` fix).
  `NetworkCapture::start` → `page.goto` → `wait_for_navigation` → read
  `document.title` → `finish()` produced **3 HAR entries**: `index.html` (200,
  text/html, 435 B), `style.css` (200, text/css, 228 B), `app.js` (200,
  text/javascript, 225 B), each with a real request URL, status, body size,
  `serverIPAddress`, and timings; the `time == send+wait+receive` invariant held on
  all three (0 violations). The written `agent_response.json` =
  `RETRIEVE`/`SUCCESS`/`retrieved_data: "Acme Widget 1299"`/`error_details: null`,
  and the written `network.har` round-tripped to a valid 1.2 log. End to end: the
  browser-free recorder, fed by a live CDP event stream, produced the exact
  WebArena-Verified per-task output.
- JUDGMENT CALLS:
  - **Sub-step (iii) deferred to the next run on purpose.** (i)+(ii) are the real
    engineering — the live event-stream pump and the contract emitter, both
    testable without external infrastructure (same discipline that made 3.3a land
    clean). (iii) needs `uv pip install "webarena-verified[examples]"`, a
    `config.json`, and a specific pinned RETRIEVE task to produce the first real
    `result.score` via offline HAR replay. That is a separate substantial chunk
    with an external-package + real-task dependency; bundling it here would have
    made this increment sloppy. Recorded as the explicit next step in STATE +
    ROADMAP (3.3b marked `[~]` in-progress, not `[x]`).
  - **`TaskStatus` models only the D26-verified terminals** (SUCCESS,
    NOT_FOUND_ERROR, PERMISSION_DENIED_ERROR). The full runner error vocabulary
    was not verified, so I did not invent values an evaluator might reject; the
    first 3.3b target is a single RETRIEVE that reports SUCCESS. Pin the full enum
    against the runner before 3.3d's multi-task loop.
  - **Macro-free pump.** The library tokio features are `rt`+`sync` only (no
    `macros`), so `tokio::select!` is unavailable; rather than widen the feature
    set I folded stop+events into one `stream::select` and drained with
    `now_or_never`. Smaller dependency surface, same behavior.
  - **Subscribe before enable.** `event_listener` is called for all four types
    before `Network.enable`, so no early request can slip between the enable ack
    and the listeners being installed.
- DECISIONS: D26's sub-steps i+ii are now confirmed (see DECISIONS.md).
- Commit sha: see the commit that lands this entry. **Phase 3.3b (i+ii) complete
  and live-verified; anchortree can now produce the WebArena-Verified per-task
  output (`agent_response.json` + a real `network.har`) for a live navigation.
  Next: 3.3b (iii) — the offline-replay eval-assertion for the first real
  `result.score`, then 3.3c re-grounding-calls instrumentation (the headline).**
