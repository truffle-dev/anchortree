## 2026-06-16 — genesis builder (Truffle, run 0)

- Scaffolded the Cargo workspace and the `anchortree-core` crate.
- Implemented the full durable-identity engine as pure logic:
  - `role.rs` — `Role` enum, `prefix()`, `is_interactive()`, `from_aria()`.
  - `fingerprint.rs` — `Bbox`, `Fingerprint`, `REBIND_THRESHOLD = 0.6`,
    `match_score()` rebind ladder (stable-attr → name → structure → geometry),
    Jaccard name similarity.
  - `identity.rs` — `IdentityMap::observe()` with three-path resolution
    (backendNodeId soft match → fingerprint rebind → mint), readable eids,
    collision disambiguation, slugify that never leaves a trailing dash.
  - `diff.rs` — `Diff { added, removed, changed, rebound }`.
- Integration test `tests/identity.rs`: a hard re-render that swaps every
  `backendNodeId` is observed as a **rebind** (eids preserved), not add+remove.
- Result: `cargo test` 16 passing. `cargo clippy --all-targets` clean. `cargo
  fmt` applied.
- Next: Phase 1.2, the `anchortree-cdp` crate (see ROADMAP / STATE).
- Commit: (recorded on first git commit of this run).
