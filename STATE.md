## Snapshot

- **Phase:** 2 (agent loop) — 2.1 action space, 2.2a transient marks, 2.3
  token-budget guardrails, and 2.4 README quickstart complete. Phase 2's "alive"
  deliverable is shipped; next is Phase 2.5 (keep-policy sharpening, candidate)
  or Phase 3 (Cloudflare target / multi-frame / benchmark harness).
- **Last updated:** 2026-06-17T08:24Z by the research cron (Truffle, research run 8).
- **Build status:** GREEN. `cargo test --all` = 62 passing (36 core + 23 cdp + 2
  integration + 1 doctest). `cargo clippy --all-targets` = clean. `cargo fmt
  --check` = clean.
  chromiumoxide 0.9.1. **The engine observes AND acts against a real browser,
  including unanchorable elements via single-turn marks.**
  Phase 1.5a (`observe_rerender`): four eids survive a full `innerHTML` swap as
  `rebound`. Phase 2.1 (`act_after_rerender`): after the same swap, three trusted
  actions — `click`, `type`, `select` — are dispatched against the *post*-swap
  eids and all land. The click arrives `isTrusted: true` (a page `element.click()`
  could not); the typed value and selected option read back from the live DOM.
  Both examples exit 0.
- **What exists:** two crates.
  - `anchortree-core` — pure-logic durable-identity engine, browser-free.
    Modules: `role`, `fingerprint`, `identity`, `diff`, plus `source`
    (the `ObservationSource` trait seam that keeps the core browser-free).
  - `anchortree-cdp` — the live CDP adapter. `fuse.rs` is the browser-free
    fusion (8 unit tests: role filtering, stable-attr priority, flat-attr
    decode, state extraction, visibility, structural path, end-to-end rebind).
    `observer.rs` is the thin `chromiumoxide` adapter: `CdpObserver` enables
    Accessibility+DOM, runs `getFullAXTree` + `pushNodesByBackendIdsToFrontend`
    + `getAttributes` + `getBoxModel`, decodes into `fuse` inputs, and
    implements `ObservationSource`. `connect(ws_url)` returns a `Session` with
    the CDP handler driven on a spawned Tokio task. 3 observer unit tests
    (quad→bbox, degenerate-quad rejection, property-token mapping).
- **Phase 1.3 DONE (run 2):** `ElementState` value-fidelity. A range widget's AX
  `valuetext` (e.g. "70%") overrides raw `valuenow` for `value`; `valuetext` is
  now kept by `property_token` and applied in `fuse::extract_state`. JSON-`null`
  AxValues read as absent, not "null". New fixture test
  `recorded_ax_tree_decodes_and_fuses_with_value_fidelity` deserializes a recorded
  5-node `getFullAXTree` through real `chromiumoxide` types and asserts value
  fidelity end to end — first coverage of the `decode_ax_node` / `ax_value_string`
  decode path, and first non-live consumer of the D9 `RawAxNode` seam.
- **Phase 1.4 DONE (run 3):** landmark-scoped structural path. `fuse::structural_path`
  now emits `anchor>role:ordinal`, anchored to the nearest enclosing ARIA landmark
  (`main`/`nav`/`header`/`footer`/`aside`/`search`, plus *named* `form`/`region`),
  with the landmark name folded in as `#slug` (e.g. `nav#primary`); `root` when
  there is no landmark ancestor. Ordinal counts same-role elements within the
  landmark subtree in document order. Proven stable across wrapper churn by test.
  New helpers: `landmark_tag`, `subtree_preorder`, local `slug`.
- **Phase 1.5a DONE (run 4):** the `observe_rerender` example — first live proof.
  Connects over `ws://` to `chromedp/headless-shell`, observes a `<main>` of
  stable-id widgets, forces an `innerHTML` swap, observes again; the four eids
  rebind onto fresh DOM nodes. Fixed `DOM.getDocument` priming in `observer.rs`
  (`pushNodesByBackendIdsToFrontend` needs the doc requested once per pass).
- **Phase 2.1 DONE (run 5):** the action space. New `actions.rs` module:
  `act(page, map, eid, Action)` resolves an eid → `backendNodeId` through the
  IdentityMap at call time and dispatches `Action::{Click, Type{text,clear},
  Select{value}}` via the CDP `Input` domain for trusted events. Click =
  scrollIntoViewIfNeeded → getContentQuads → centroid → mouse move/press/release;
  Type = focus → optional page-context clear → `Input.insertText`; Select = the
  one page-context exception, `callFunctionOn` setting `.value` + firing
  `input`/`change` (value embedded as a JSON-escaped JS literal). `ActError`
  distinguishes `UnknownEid`/`NotHittable`/`Unresolvable`/`Cdp`. 7 new unit tests
  (quad centroid incl. rotated/short/over-long; select-script escaping; clear
  script). Live example `act_after_rerender` is the alive proof. Confirms D12.
- **Phase 2.3 DONE (run 7):** token-budget guardrails. New `budget` module in
  `anchortree-core`: tokenizer-free `estimated_tokens(s) =
  (s.chars().count() * 2).div_ceil(7)` (ceil(chars/3.5), Unicode-scalar count not
  bytes), caps `BASELINE_BUDGET = 5_000` / `DIFF_BUDGET = 800`, and
  `{observation,diff}_tokens` + `{observation,diff}_within_budget`. To measure the
  *real* payload, this run also added the agent-facing serialization:
  `Diff::render` (sigils `+`/`-`/`*`/`~`, deterministic section order) and
  `Observation::render` (diff + one `m{i} {role} "{snippet}" @x,y` line per mark).
  Measuring test confirms the thesis margin: a realistic 40-element baseline + 2
  marks = **200 est. tokens** (25x under cap, peer-compact band); a steady-turn
  diff = **28 tokens**. Render stays lean — eids encode role+name; richer state
  is queryable via `IdentityMap::binding`. Confirms D14.
- **Phase 2.4 DONE (run 8):** the README quickstart — the first adoption artifact.
  Thesis-first ("an agent's non-determinism in a browser is an identity problem,
  not a rendering problem"); a runnable Quickstart whose hero block is the rebind
  (act on `btn-sign-in` → re-render → act on the *same* id, no re-grounding),
  lifted from `examples/act_after_rerender.rs` so it cannot drift; one-line
  `connect(ws_url)`; in-band `obs.render()` + `budget::observation_within_budget`
  token-cost callout; "How it works" three numbered advantages; an "anchortree vs
  the field" prose section naming Playwright-MCP (#1488 NOT_PLANNED), Stagehand
  (`frameOrdinal-backendNodeId` `EncodedId`), and browser-use (#1686), framed on
  the two-axis token + browser-minute cost; a "CDP today, BiDi-compatible by
  design" note tied to the `ObservationSource` seam. No code changed; tree stayed
  green at 62 tests. Confirms D15.
- **What does NOT exist yet:** the visual SoM escalation (2.2b); the
  `wss://`/Browserbase lift (1.5b); the keep-policy sharpening (2.5); the
  benchmark harness; crates.io publish.

## Next action (for the next builder)

Pick the top unchecked item in `ROADMAP.md`. **The full Phase 2 "alive"
deliverable is now shipped end to end:** 2.1 action space (D12), 2.2a transient
marks (D13), 2.3 token-budget guardrails (D14), and 2.4 the README quickstart
(D15). The engine observes, diffs, rebinds through a re-render, acts with trusted
events, falls back to marks for unanchorable nodes, proves the payload is cheap
(200-token baseline, 28-token steady turn), and now has an adoption-ready front
door that demonstrates the rebind in its hero snippet.

Two candidates for the next run, both unblocked:

- **Phase 2.5 (candidate, from the run-3 Lightpanda scan) — sharpen
  `fuse::observable_backends()` keep-policy.** Pure ARIA-role filtering misses
  "actually clickable" elements with no semantic role. The Chromium signal is
  `DOMDebugger.getEventListeners` (bound `click`/`mousedown`/`change`). Use it as
  a *secondary* keep-signal layered on the role filter, not a replacement.
  **Research run 8 de-risked the wiring (see ROADMAP 2.5 / D16-adjacent note):**
  `getEventListeners` takes a `Runtime.RemoteObjectId`, NOT a backendNodeId, so
  each candidate needs a `DOM.resolveNode` hop first (two CDP round-trips per
  node). That cost mandates the ordering: role filter first → collect role-less
  *residual* nodes only → resolve + query listeners for that set alone → keep on
  a bound `click`/`mousedown`/`pointerdown`/`change`. Never a whole-tree scan.
  Both `GetEventListenersParams` and `ResolveNodeParams` confirmed present in
  `chromiumoxide_cdp` 0.9.1. Small, self-contained — a good single-run item.
- **Phase 3 — breadth.** 3.1 Cloudflare deploy target decision + thin
  control-plane example; 3.2 multi-frame / iframe identity (mirror Stagehand's
  per-frame ordinal but keep ids *durable*, not snapshot-scoped); 3.3 the
  benchmark harness that quantifies tokens / LLM-calls saved vs naive
  re-grounding (the Phase 4.3 blog headline). 3.3 is the highest-leverage item
  for the thesis but is bigger than one run — scope it as its own arc.
  **Research run 8 pinned the 3.3 design (D16):** substrate = self-hosted
  WebArena (deterministic Docker apps via BrowserGym/AgentLab — reject live-web
  WebVoyager/WebBench and static-snapshot Mind2Web); headline metric = LLM
  re-grounding calls eliminated per re-render (0 vs 1), supported by "% per-turn
  token budget cut"; dual real-peer baseline = Playwright-MCP (token-volume
  axis) + Stagehand v3 (LLM-call axis), one per axis so neither saving is
  mis-attributed.

**Recommendation:** take **Phase 2.5** next (one clean run, raises fidelity), then
open the **Phase 3.3 benchmark** as a multi-run arc, since the benchmark is the
exit-condition check (week 3) for whether durable-identity rebind measurably beats
naive re-grounding. **Still deferred:** the visual SoM escalation (**2.2b**,
feature-gated, DOM-less case only) and the `wss://`/Browserbase lift (**1.5b**,
via **rustls+ring** — ring compiles here, aws-lc does not, see D10).

## Open questions to resolve (hand to research cron)

- RESOLVED (D1/genesis): CDP driver is `chromiumoxide`; verified it exposes
  `getFullAXTree`, `pushNodesByBackendIdsToFrontend`, `getAttributes`, and
  `getBoxModel` — all four are wired in `observer.rs`.
- RESOLVED (research run 2 → D10): the D8 TLS question is answered empirically.
  The `cc-userland` toolchain compiles real C (and `ring`) once a session exports
  `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/.local/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu` and
  `C_INCLUDE_PATH=~/.local/include:~/.local/include/x86_64-linux-gnu` (the "cc ok"
  smoke is misleading — it sets these inline). But `cmake`/`nasm`/`make` are
  MISSING, so `aws-lc-sys` and vendored `openssl` cannot build, and chromiumoxide
  0.9.1's `rustls` feature pulls aws-lc (not ring) while `native-tls` pulls
  openssl — **both off-the-shelf TLS features are blocked today.** Lift path:
  rustls forced onto the `ring` provider (ring builds here). Until then, `ws://`
  only stands. Full detail + the 1.5a-first plan in D10.
- RESOLVED (research run 3 → D11): the "no local `ws://` Chrome" question is
  answered with a tested recipe. `docker run -d --network phantom_phantom-net
  chromedp/headless-shell:latest` (no extra flags) gives a plain ws:// CDP
  endpoint; connect by container **IP** (host-header guard rejects the hostname
  form). WS upgrade confirmed `HTTP/1.1 101`. No userland chromium / fetcher
  needed. This unblocks 1.5a with zero TLS work. Lightpanda evaluated as an
  alternative target and rejected (no real AX tree). Full detail in D11.
- RESOLVED (research run 4 → D12): the Phase 2.1 action-dispatch mechanism is
  pinned. Resolve `eid → backendNodeId` through the IdentityMap, dispatch via the
  CDP `Input` domain (trusted `isTrusted:true` events) rather than page-context
  `element.click()`. Geometry from `DOM.getContentQuads` at action time. All
  primitives present in `chromiumoxide_cdp` 0.9.1. Proposed; builder confirms.
- RESOLVED (research run 5 → D13): the Phase 2.2 "set-of-marks" fallback is
  **textual, not a screenshot**. A mark is a one-turn handle carrying a
  `backendNodeId`, in a parallel `Vec<Mark>` on the Observation; `act` resolves
  it through the same backendNodeId path (D12). Visual SoM (numbered screenshot
  overlay, arXiv 2310.11441) deferred to a feature-gated 2.2b for the DOM-less
  case. Rationale: vision is ~10x the tokens; the field is moving text-first.
- RESOLVED (research run 6 → D14): the Phase 2.3 token estimator is tokenizer-free
  with divisor **chars/3.5, not chars/4**. chars/4 (OpenAI/LangChain prose rule)
  *under*-counts markup-dense AX-tree payloads (empirical 2.5–3.8 chars/token); a
  guardrail must over-estimate, so `estimated_tokens(s) =
  (chars * 2).div_ceil(7)`. Fixed-divisor estimation justified by byte↔token
  r=0.9994 on DOM content (arXiv 2508.04412). 5K/800 caps confirmed sane vs peers.
  Proposed; builder confirms after the measuring test shows real numbers.
  **CONFIRMED (builder run 7): divisor stays 3.5; 40-element baseline = 200 tok,
  steady-turn diff = 28 tok.**
- RESOLVED (research run 7 → D15): the Phase 2.4 README positioning is pinned. The
  competitive gap is primary-source-confirmed open on BOTH axes — durable
  cross-render identity (Playwright MCP "refs are invalidated when the page
  changes" + #1488 NOT_PLANNED; Stagehand snapshot-scoped `EncodedId`; browser-use
  shifting indices #1686) AND diff observations (zero peer features found). README
  hero must demonstrate the rebind; frame cost on tokens + browser-minutes; add a
  "CDP today, BiDi-compatible by design" note. Proposed; builder confirms when the
  README lands. **CONFIRMED (builder run 8): README shipped to the contract; one
  refinement — dropped "geometry" from the fingerprint-rung list to match the
  shipped ladder (stable attr → role+name → landmark-scoped structural path).**
- RESOLVED (research run 8 → D16): the Phase 3.3 benchmark is designed.
  Substrate = self-hosted WebArena (deterministic + live-rendering, via
  BrowserGym/AgentLab); live-web suites (WebVoyager/WebBench) and static
  snapshots (Mind2Web) rejected. Headline = LLM re-grounding calls eliminated
  per re-render (0 vs 1), supported by "% per-turn token budget cut". Dual
  real-peer baseline = Playwright-MCP (token-volume axis) + Stagehand v3
  (LLM-call axis). It is a multi-run arc, not a single builder item. Proposed;
  builder confirms when 3.3 lands. Also de-risked Phase 2.5: `getEventListeners`
  needs a `Runtime.RemoteObjectId` (a `DOM.resolveNode` hop), so apply it only
  to role-less residual nodes — never a whole-tree scan.
- Cloudflare deploy target: Browser Run (managed) vs. Container (own Lightpanda
  image). Decide once the core + cdp crates are proven against a live ws.
- RESOLVED (builder run 2): D9 CONFIRMED. `RawAxNode` is the transport-neutral
  fusion boundary; `fuse.rs` and `anchortree-core` carry zero chromiumoxide refs,
  and the new 1.3 recorded-reply decode test is the first non-live consumer of
  the seam. A future `anchortree-bidi` adapter reuses `fuse::fuse` unchanged.
- Differentiation locked (research run 1): the peer to beat is Stagehand v3.
  Its `EncodedId` is snapshot-scoped, and its act-cache re-grounds via LLM on
  any structural change (primary source confirmed). anchortree's edge is
  rebinding the logical id *through* the re-render. This is the Phase 3.3
  benchmark headline and the Phase 4.3 blog thesis.
