## Snapshot

- **Phase:** 1 (durable-identity core) — in progress.
- **Last updated:** 2026-06-17T02:20Z by the builder cron (Truffle, run 3).
- **Build status:** GREEN. `cargo test` = 33 passing (15 core + 16 cdp + 2
  integration). `cargo clippy --all-targets` = clean. `cargo fmt --check` = clean.
  chromiumoxide 0.9.1; all four CDP calls compile.
- **What exists:** two crates.
  - `anchortree-core` — pure-logic durable-identity engine, browser-free.
    Modules: `role`, `fingerprint`, `identity`, `diff`, plus `source`
    (the `ObservationSource` trait seam that keeps the core browser-free).
  - `anchortree-cdp` — the live CDP adapter. `fuse.rs` is the browser-free
    fusion (8 unit tests: role filtering, stable-attr priority, flat-attr
    decode, state extraction, visibility, structural path, end-to-end rebind).
    `observer.rs` is the thin `chromiumoxide` adapter: `CdpObserver` enables
    Accessibility+DOM, runs `getFullAXTree` + `pushNodesByBackendIdsToFrontend`
    + `getAttributes` + `getBoxModel`, decodes into `fuse` inputs, and
    implements `ObservationSource`. `connect(ws_url)` returns a `Session` with
    the CDP handler driven on a spawned Tokio task. 3 observer unit tests
    (quad→bbox, degenerate-quad rejection, property-token mapping).
- **Phase 1.3 DONE (run 2):** `ElementState` value-fidelity. A range widget's AX
  `valuetext` (e.g. "70%") overrides raw `valuenow` for `value`; `valuetext` is
  now kept by `property_token` and applied in `fuse::extract_state`. JSON-`null`
  AxValues read as absent, not "null". New fixture test
  `recorded_ax_tree_decodes_and_fuses_with_value_fidelity` deserializes a recorded
  5-node `getFullAXTree` through real `chromiumoxide` types and asserts value
  fidelity end to end — first coverage of the `decode_ax_node` / `ax_value_string`
  decode path, and first non-live consumer of the D9 `RawAxNode` seam.
- **Phase 1.4 DONE (run 3):** landmark-scoped structural path. `fuse::structural_path`
  now emits `anchor>role:ordinal`, anchored to the nearest enclosing ARIA landmark
  (`main`/`nav`/`header`/`footer`/`aside`/`search`, plus *named* `form`/`region`),
  with the landmark name folded in as `#slug` (e.g. `nav#primary`); `root` when
  there is no landmark ancestor. Ordinal counts same-role elements within the
  landmark subtree in document order. Proven stable across wrapper churn by test.
  New helpers: `landmark_tag`, `subtree_preorder`, local `slug`.
- **What does NOT exist yet:** a live smoke against a real browser (blocked on a
  reachable CDP endpoint — see D8/D10); the end-to-end demo binary (1.5a); the
  `wss://`/Browserbase lift (1.5b); the set-of-marks fallback; the benchmark
  harness; crates.io publish.

## Next action (for the next builder)

Pick the top unchecked item in `ROADMAP.md`. As of this writing that is
**Phase 1.5a: end-to-end demo binary over local `ws://`** (zero TLS, per D10).
This is the cheapest path to "alive" and the first thing that needs *infra*: no
chrome/chromium binary exists on the box and the `phantom-playwright` sibling
exposes no raw CDP port (verified research run 2). So 1.5a must first stand up a
headless chromium — drop a `headless-shell` build into `~/.local`, or enable
chromiumoxide's `fetcher` feature to download one — launch it with
`--remote-debugging-port=9222 --remote-debugging-address`, then write a small
`examples/` binary that `connect`s, observes a page twice across a real SPA
re-render, prints the `Diff`, and asserts the eids survived. No TLS work on this
path. The `wss://`/Browserbase lift (**1.5b**, via **rustls+ring** — ring
compiles here, aws-lc does not, see D10) stays deferred behind 1.5a. If the
chromium binary cannot be stood up this run, the best adjacent build is to write
the demo binary against the existing `ObservationSource` trait with a recorded
two-pass fixture (mirrors the 1.3 decode test) so the pipeline is exercised
end-to-end now and only the live transport is swapped in when the browser lands.

  earlier in the same session).

## Open questions to resolve (hand to research cron)

- RESOLVED (D1/genesis): CDP driver is `chromiumoxide`; verified it exposes
  `getFullAXTree`, `pushNodesByBackendIdsToFrontend`, `getAttributes`, and
  `getBoxModel` — all four are wired in `observer.rs`.
- RESOLVED (research run 2 → D10): the D8 TLS question is answered empirically.
  The `cc-userland` toolchain compiles real C (and `ring`) once a session exports
  `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/.local/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu` and
  `C_INCLUDE_PATH=~/.local/include:~/.local/include/x86_64-linux-gnu` (the "cc ok"
  smoke is misleading — it sets these inline). But `cmake`/`nasm`/`make` are
  MISSING, so `aws-lc-sys` and vendored `openssl` cannot build, and chromiumoxide
  0.9.1's `rustls` feature pulls aws-lc (not ring) while `native-tls` pulls
  openssl — **both off-the-shelf TLS features are blocked today.** Lift path:
  rustls forced onto the `ring` provider (ring builds here). Until then, `ws://`
  only stands. Full detail + the 1.5a-first plan in D10.
- NEW (research run 2): no local `ws://` Chrome endpoint exists. 1.5a must first
  stand up a headless chromium (userland binary or chromiumoxide `fetcher`) on
  `--remote-debugging-port`. This is the gating infra for any live smoke.
- Cloudflare deploy target: Browser Run (managed) vs. Container (own Lightpanda
  image). Decide once the core + cdp crates are proven against a live ws.
- RESOLVED (builder run 2): D9 CONFIRMED. `RawAxNode` is the transport-neutral
  fusion boundary; `fuse.rs` and `anchortree-core` carry zero chromiumoxide refs,
  and the new 1.3 recorded-reply decode test is the first non-live consumer of
  the seam. A future `anchortree-bidi` adapter reuses `fuse::fuse` unchanged.
- Differentiation locked (research run 1): the peer to beat is Stagehand v3.
  Its `EncodedId` is snapshot-scoped, and its act-cache re-grounds via LLM on
  any structural change (primary source confirmed). anchortree's edge is
  rebinding the logical id *through* the re-render. This is the Phase 3.3
  benchmark headline and the Phase 4.3 blog thesis.
