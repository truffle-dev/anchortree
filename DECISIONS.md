## D1 — anchortree is a library over CDP, not a browser or a fleet (2026-06-16)

We do not build or host browsers. Browserbase/Kernel run Firecracker microVMs;
Steel/Hyperbrowser run containers. That is an infra business. Our differentiator
is the *interface*: durable element identity + diff observations over **any**
CDP endpoint (local Chrome, Lightpanda, Browserbase, Cloudflare Browser Run).
This keeps the core small, testable, and useful to anyone regardless of where
their browser runs.

## D2 — the problem is identity, not rendering (2026-06-16)

Existing agent-browser tooling re-grounds every turn (screenshot, re-run
selectors). The expensive, non-deterministic part is *re-finding* the element
the agent already knew about after the agent's own click or a framework
re-render swapped the DOM node. We solve that once, durably, and everything
else (diffs, action space) follows.

## D3 — Rust, edition 2024 (2026-06-16) — operator override

The design doc (`docs/DESIGN.md`) originally recommended TypeScript for
ecosystem reach. Operator directed "build it in a cutting-edge language."
Chosen: Rust. Reasoning: single static binary any agent can just run; mature
CDP via `chromiumoxide`; matches the Lightpanda/agent-browser performance
ethos; the durable-identity core is pure logic that benefits from Rust's
exhaustive enums and ownership. The TS recommendation in DESIGN.md is retained
as historical context but is **superseded by this decision**.

## D4 — durable-identity core FIRST, browser plumbing second (2026-06-16)

The identity engine is the differentiator and is pure logic, so it is fully
unit-testable without driving Chrome. Building it first gives us a green,
proven core before we take on the messier CDP integration. The core crate
(`anchortree-core`) is deliberately browser-free; it operates on `ObservedNode`
values that a later `anchortree-cdp` crate will produce.

## D5 — `backendNodeId` is the primary key; fingerprint is the rebind (2026-06-16)

CDP `backendNodeId` is document-lifetime-stable, so it is the cheap primary key
while a DOM node lives. When a node is destroyed and recreated (hard
re-render), we rebind the logical `eid` to the new node by scoring the old
fingerprint against candidates. The rebind ladder, strongest rung first:
stable attribute (id/name/data-testid/aria-label) → (role, accessible-name) →
structural path → geometry. Threshold `REBIND_THRESHOLD = 0.6`; below it we
mint a fresh identity rather than risk a wrong rebind. A role mismatch or two
disagreeing stable attributes hard-veto a match.

## D6 — eids are human-and-agent readable (2026-06-16)

Minted ids carry a role prefix and a slug of the accessible name, e.g.
`btn-sign-in`, `inp-email`. An agent reading the id infers the action space
without a second lookup. Collisions disambiguate with a numeric suffix
(`btn-edit`, `btn-edit-1`). Slugs truncate to 24 chars then trim trailing
separators so an id never ends in a dash.

## D7 — coordination via git docs (primary) + transcripts (secondary) (2026-06-16)

Two crons (hourly builder, 45-min researcher) hand off through structured
markdown committed to git: `STATE`, `DECISIONS`, `ROADMAP`, `BUILD_LOG`,
`RESEARCH_LOG`, `HANDOFF`, `LOCK`. These are authoritative. Raw session
transcripts on the volume are a secondary deep-context source, pointed to from
`STATE.md`. Rationale: an agent cannot reliably introspect its own live session
id, and structured docs are smaller and intentional, whereas transcripts are
large and noisy.
